                                    <p>One of the many benefits of working at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> is the relatively
little-known weight management benefit. Essentially, the benefit pays for a
large majority of a diet/weight loss/exercise program administered by the <a href="http://www.proclub.com/">Pro
Club</a>, the semi-official Microsoft sports club. I found out about it fairly
soon after I started, and I knew I wanted to get involved, but I didn&#8217;t have
the time. Finally, about a month ago, I took the plunge and got things&nbsp;going.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been overweight for as long as I can remember, and though I&#8217;ve been
relatively static the past few years in terms of weight gain, I&#8217;ve known for
awhile that I need to do something about it. Since I&#8217;m making use of all the
other Microsoft benefits (getting my teeth fixed, medical check-ups, etc) I
figured I might as well do&nbsp;everything.</p>
<p>Anyway, I officially started on the diet last Thursday and the exercise the
previous day. This week I&#8217;ve lost <strong>13.6 pounds.</strong> That&#8217;s a lot, I know, but I
should put this in perspective. I work out 90 minutes 3 days a week with a
personal trainer, and 60 minutes 3 more days a week by myself. I bought a
heart rate monitor and with the help of Jeremiah, my trainer, am learning how
to do heart-rate-focused work-outs. But the big thing last week was the&nbsp;diet…</p>
<p>Basically I ate nothing but chicken, protein shakes, and a little peanut
butter. The dietitian called it ‘detox&#8217; and she was right. I had withdrawal
symptoms including severe headaches and numbness in my hands and feet for the
first 4-5 days. It seems like most of it has passed though, and fortunately
this week I get to add veggies back into my diet. I went out for a salad at
lunch and it was quite possibly the best thing I&#8217;ve ever had in my entire life
after 7 days of chicken and protein shakes. I also talked about my aversion to
the protein shakes (I had to drink 5 per day, so I was getting pretty sick of
them) with the dietician and she moved me to another diet without the&nbsp;shakes.</p>
<p>I was having a lot of trouble keeping my calories up. I&#8217;m supposed to eat
between 1500 and 1600 a day, but last week I averaged ~1300. I was sluggish
and mentally challenged the whole week, so I am eager to get my count back up
so I can feel better while still losing the weight and eating better. I think
I&#8217;ll be a little happier now with the variety. Plus, with the veggies back and
yogurt coming back next week, I should be good to&nbsp;go.</p>
<p>I am pleased with the progress so far, but I do miss the freedom I exercised
previously when it came to food. As things go on, I&#8217;ll be adding more food
groups back in, so I should be <span class="caps">OK</span>. The weirdest thing about the whole program
is the counseling stuff. The counselor is awesome, and I only meet with here
once a month or so, but she gave me a business card that just said Sara
S&#8212;&#8211;, Psychotherapy. That word just seems scary to me, especially since I
don&#8217;t consider myself psychotic or even ‘troubled&#8217; but&nbsp;whatever.</p>
<p>Anyway, 1 week down, 19 left to&nbsp;go.</p>

it seems that you can <strong>finally</strong> get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009IW8AI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tylerbutlerco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0009IW8AI">the first season on <span class="caps">DVD</span></a>. All I can

                                    <p>I decided this morning that I was going to try and learn <span class="caps">XSLT</span> today. I think I
succeeded somewhat. I decided that my tutorial application would be an iTunes
<span class="caps">XML</span> feed transformed into a page on my site with the most recent songs I&#8217;ve
listened to in iTunes. I created my own iTunes <span class="caps">XML</span> schema (a really really
simple one), though in retropect, I probably should have just tried to use the
built-in iTunes <span class="caps">XML</span> stuff (though I don&#8217;t know if this capability is exposed
in the <span class="caps">SDK</span>). Anyway, once I had the <span class="caps">XML</span> (created by my program in C# and the
iTunes <span class="caps">COM</span> <span class="caps">SDK</span>), I started fooling with the <span class="caps">XSLT</span>. It still needs a lot of
style work, but I managed to get it formatting the data the right way and&nbsp;everything.</p>
<p>The album art is actually taken directly from the metadata on the audio files
in my collection, not from another source like Amazon. I think this is a
better solution because I have some crazy stuff that Amazon simply doesn&#8217;t
know about. Besides, I spent a long time trying to clean up the album art in
my music collection, and though there are still a lot of gaps, I might as well
get some reward for all my hard&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>As far as the <span class="caps">XSLT</span> is concerned, it&#8217;s pretty easy stuff, I guess, but there
are a lot of &#8220;gotchas.&#8221; For example, I couldn&#8217;t get things to render in
Firefox until I added the &#8220;&#8221; line. It was working fine in <span class="caps">IE</span> and I couldn&#8217;t
figure out what the heck was wrong. Plus, if you&#8217;re not careful about dividing
your templates for different elements up properly, things come out pretty
wierd. Also, my Apache web server isn&#8217;t configured right, I guess, because it
messes up the <span class="caps">MIME</span> types on *.xslt files, so for awhile, Firefox complained it
couldn&#8217;t attach the stylesheet. Rather than fool with Apache, I just changed
the extension of the stylesheet. How&#8217;s that for&nbsp;lazy?</p>
<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s the xml file with attached stylesheet: <a href="/SiteCollectionDocuments/Post%20Content/nowplaying.xml">nowplaying.xml</a>.
Obviously, you&#8217;ll need at least <span class="caps">IE</span> 6.0 or Firefox (or another <span class="caps">XSLT</span>-ready
browser)to see it right. And here&#8217;s the <a href="/SiteCollectionDocuments/Post%20Content/fullview.xsl"><span class="caps">XSLT</span> itself</a>. Like I said, I want
to do a lot more styling, but I have been doing this stuff all day, so I&#8217;m
calling it quits for&nbsp;now.</p>

other day, it kindly reminded me, with a happy-looking purple box that I have
no friends yet. Totally brightened my day. It would have been worse, but at
least there was a link there where I could get a friend if I needed one. Too
bad life&#8217;s not that easy. Anyway, add me to your friends&#8217; list if you have&nbsp;Netflix.</p>
<p><em>Lest some of you get the wrong idea&#8230; All of the above is mostly sarcastic.
I have lots of friends. I just thought the fact that Netflix would blatantly
say &#8220;No friends yet&#8221; on their website was&nbsp;funny.</em></p>
