                </header>
                                    <p>A lot of people have made a big deal about the limitations of the <a href="http://www.zune.net/">Zune</a>
wireless functionality since it was released a few weeks ago. While I totally
agree that there is a lot of untapped potential with the device currently,
there is at least one &#8220;obvious&#8221; omission that people have pointed out that
simply isn&#8217;t a good idea, to be&nbsp;honest.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about syncing to the device using the wireless. Sounds cool,
right? You just walk into your apartment, turn on the Zune, and Boom! All of
your music is synchronized to it. But what people don&#8217;t seem to realize is how
slow this would be. The maximum bandwidth for <span class="caps">USB</span> 2.0 is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_2.0#Transfer_speed">480 Mbit/s</a>, or
60 <span class="caps">MB</span>/s. 802.11g, on the other hand, has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.11g#802.11g">maximum raw data rate of 54
Mbit/s</a>, or about 24.7 Mbit/s net throughput. Now, by applying some simple&nbsp;mathematics:</p>
<p>480 / 24.7 =&nbsp;19.4332</p>
<p>This means that syncing to your device using wireless would be roughly 20
times slower than using <span class="caps">USB</span> 2.0. Even if we assume the theoretical max data
rate for 802.11g, which isn&#8217;t realistic, to be clear, you&#8217;re still looking at
a transfer speed that&#8217;s ten times slower. And don&#8217;t even think about using
802.11b. Frankly, this doesn&#8217;t sound like a good&nbsp;idea.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>So what?&#8221; you say. &#8220;I can leave the Zune syncing all night and it&#8217;ll be ready
to go in the morning. Speed isn&#8217;t a real issue.&#8221; <span class="caps">OK</span>, fine. You walk into your
apartment, you turn on your Zune, and it starts syncing. You go to bed. You
wake up the next morning, and your Zune is finished syncing, but it&#8217;s battery
has also been drained. Good luck using it on your&nbsp;commute.</p>
<p>So what do you do next time? You plug it in so it can charge while it&#8217;s
syncing. But at this point, why not just plug it directly into your computer
to sync and charge at the same time, at a much faster rate? So to me, it&#8217;s
clear that isn&#8217;t really a desirable feature, and I&#8217;ll bet that some Program
Manager on the Zune team came to the same&nbsp;conclusion.</p>
<p>One thing that I will point out, however, is that many times, when you sync,
you&#8217;re not syncing that much data. Your library hasn&#8217;t changed that much, and
the only thing that&#8217;s being synced is play counts or updated track info or
something. In that case, this feature might make sense. The amount of data
wouldn&#8217;t be large, so the process wouldn&#8217;t take long and the battery drain
would be minimal. There might be some scenarios where this feature would be
useful. However, I think that a lot of people had a knee-jerk reaction and
haven&#8217;t really thought through the ramifications and technical limitations of
that feature. But hey, that&#8217;s what we <span class="caps">PM</span>&#8217;s get paid for, right?&nbsp;:-)</p>

                                    <p>My friend <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/">Patrick</a> managed to <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/wii/wiik-wiith-wii.xml">get his hands on a Wii</a>, and I am a bit
jealous, to say the least. My own weekend Wii hunt did not go well, but I plan
to persevere and head back out next weekend. Supposedly the Redmond
<a href="http://www.target.com/">Target</a> is getting a bunch in on December 17th, so I&#8217;ll be standing in
line if you want to join&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>However, this post is _really _meant to be about <a href="http://microformats.org/">Microformats</a>, an
interesting little technology that allows you to add a bit more metadata to
existing markup, ostensibly to provide a better way to work with that data and
leverage it in unique ways. I learned about it at the Gilbane Conference a
couple weeks ago, and I wanted to do some checking to make sure you could
leverage them on your <span class="caps">MOSS</span> site if you wanted. Seems like you can, as this
post&nbsp;suggests.</p>
<p>If you view this post in Firefox you&#8217;ll see a little icon next to Patrick&#8217;s
picture above. This is done using <span class="caps">CSS</span>, but you won&#8217;t see it in <span class="caps">IE</span> because <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/beforeafter.html"><span class="caps">IE</span>
doesn&#8217;t support <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code></a>. But anyway, this isn&#8217;t all that
interesting, because I could already do that using <span class="caps">CSS</span>. What _is _interesting,
however, is if you go to <a href="http://inside.glnetworks.de/2006/06/05/microformats-have-arrived-in-firefox-15-greasemonkey-06/">http://inside.glnetworks.de/2006/06/05/microformats-
have-arrived-in-firefox-15-greasemonkey-06/</a> and download the <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey
</a>script there. Then return to this page, and you&#8217;ll see that miraculously
the following menu has been added above Patrick&#8217;s&nbsp;name:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/SiteCollectionImages/Post%20Images/hcard%20sample.PNG" /></p>
<p>Nifty, huh? If you&#8217;re using that same Greasemonkey script you&#8217;ll also notice
that the text above about standing in line to get a Wii at Target is an event
that you can add to your&nbsp;calendar:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/SiteCollectionImages/Post%20Images/hcal%20sample.PNG" /></p>
<p>All of the data in the sentence I wrote is wrapped in some appropriate tags
that a compatible client reader (Firefox + Greasemonkey script in this case)
can parse out and act on. Plus, because it&#8217;s well-known markup, there&#8217;s a nice
backwards compatibility story for downlevel clients. For example, looking at
this page in <span class="caps">IE</span> is pretty boring, but stuff lights up when you use Firefox and
the&nbsp;script.</p>
<p>Anyway, this all goes to show that there is a lot of opportunity for
Microformats to take off if there&#8217;s better client support. Just consider <span class="caps">RSS</span> -
now browsers inherently know how to read some markup in the header of the page
and automatically detect <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds on a page. It&#8217;s not hard to image a time
when Firefox will include the functionality currently offered through the
Greasemonkey script natively. Plus there&#8217;s some great tools already out there
for dealing with this type of data. Just check out this link to Technorati,
which will <a href="http://technorati.com/contacts/http://www.tylerbutler.com/geekdom/Pages/PatrickHasaWii,or,ExperimentingwithMicroformats.aspx">automatically parse out the hCards on this page</a> and let you
download them as&nbsp;vCards.</p>
<p>I could also write some code that runs on the server and outputs special
JavaScript and <span class="caps">CSS</span> when Microformats are encountered. Then no client side
support would be necesarry. I&#8217;ll be looking into this in the next few weeks.
Anyway, I think there&#8217;s a lot of potential to include Microformats in more
places on my site, so keep your eyes&nbsp;peeled.</p>

                                    <p>Many comedians begin their routine by stating the obvious differences between
two groups of people. Perhaps it&#8217;s men and women, or white and black, or
whatever. We humans <em>love</em> to categorize other people into groups. Pessimists
and optimists, liberals and conservatives, the list goes on and on. Well, I&#8217;m
not going to buck tradition that much; I am convinced that there are two basic
types of people as well: problem <em>solvers</em> and problem <em>finders.</em></p>
<p>The definition for these two groups is fairly self-evident. A problem finder
is someone who excels at finding problems. That&#8217;s a pretty large scope, to be
sure. These are the types of people that are never satisfied. They find
something to complain about in every situation. When you ask how they&#8217;re
doing, they say things like, &#8220;Well, I could be better.&#8221; They are experts in
identifying the nearly-invisible cracks in the glass, the slight imbalance in
the supposedly symmetrical piece of&nbsp;machinery.</p>
<p>You may be saying to yourself that this type of person is a pessimist, but I
maintain that an important distinction between a problem finder and a
pessimist is that a problem finder can be very specific about exactly <em>what</em>
in a given situation or event is bad, while a pessimist is less able to do
this in general. A pessimist can tell you how bad he thinks it is, but getting
down to specifics is difficult because it&#8217;s not about specific issues or
problems he sees, it&#8217;s about the way he perceives his environment and the
events surrounding him. Hope that distinction makes&nbsp;sense.</p>
<p>Obviously a problem solver is someone who solves problems. These aren&#8217;t
particularly complex definitions, are they? This is the type of person
that is constantly trying to save the world. You have a problem? They have a
solution! Well, they believe they do. There is nothing they can&#8217;t help you
with. If they&#8217;re self-aware enough to realize they <em>don&#8217;t</em> know the answer,
then they&#8217;ll happily redirect you to someone who does. After all, they have a
pathological need to solve your problem, whether that&#8217;s what you want or not.
Sometimes, you just want someone to listen to your story about your horrible
experience or situation, and simply agree with you. &#8220;Yeah, that <em>does</em> suck!&#8221;
&#8220;Yeah, that pisses me off too!&#8221; You&#8217;re looking for a friendly acknowledgement
of the suckiness of your situation, and it can be frustrating when a problem
solver patronizes you by offering what they think is a simple solution for
your problem. &#8220;What are you complaining about? Take action!&#8221; they&nbsp;say.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s clear that everyone has a bit of both of these quirks in their
personalities. We all are proactive about solving problems on some occasions,
and sometimes we&#8217;re very good about finding the problems, the holes, the
cracks. However, since I am an engineer, and I work with engineers, I have
concluded that engineers are predominately problem&nbsp;solvers.</p>
<p>This makes sense. What is engineering? At its core, it&#8217;s finding elegant
solutions to complex problems while maintaining an awareness of the needs and
constraints of the solution (such as cost). It&#8217;s problem solving, pure and
simple, so it is not unusual that good engineers are good problem solvers.
However, I maintain that problem finders are equally, if not more important
than problem solvers, if only because good ones are harder to&nbsp;find.</p>
<p>I know plenty of engineers who can solve problems in fantastic, elegant ways,
but can&#8217;t easily identify the problems in their solutions, or even potential
problems outside of the original problem description that was given to them.
They need someone who can do that for them. The best teams at Microsoft in my
opinion have a cynic, a guy who takes everything and tears it apart. It&#8217;s
_never _good enough. And the best problem solvers I know are able to take that
information and make a better&nbsp;solution.</p>
<p>So I guess my conclusion is that it&#8217;s <span class="caps">OK</span> if you&#8217;re not the best problem solver
or problem finder. Just <em>know</em> that you aren&#8217;t. Self-awareness is the key, you
know. In my own case, I have realized that I am a much better problem
finder. I&#8217;m a natural cynic, and a bit of a perfectionist. And hey, I&#8217;m <span class="caps">OK</span>
with&nbsp;that.</p>

                                    <p>It was a bit of a toss-up whether to categorize this post under Geekdom,
Daily Dose of Tyler, or Work, since this project certainly has a bit
of all three. However, since I haven&#8217;t gotten around to implementing arbitrary
tagging on my site, I can only pick one, so I went with work. Anyway, as you
can see from visiting this site, I am in the process of transitioning things
from my old <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/">GeekLog</a>-based system to <span class="caps">MOSS</span> 2007. (A quick note on GeekLog -
I love it. It&#8217;s been great for me, it has a lot of great features, it&#8217;s
customizable, highly recommended! The only reason I&#8217;m moving is because I
helped build <span class="caps">MOSS</span>, and I like it a&nbsp;lot.)</p>
<p>Anyway, you can follow my progress by checking out <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ecm/archive/2006/10/30/building-tylerbutler-com-part-1-planning-and-basic-branding.aspx">my first post</a> on this
process at the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ecm">Enterprise Content Management blog</a>. There will be several
more posts over there, and I am working on an in-depth piece-by-piece feature
breakdown for the site that I&#8217;ll put up here at some point. Gotta get the site
finished first,&nbsp;though.</p>
<p>This is a bit of a sandbox right now, as I am still actively working on the
implementation of the site. It might go up and down, and things will probably
look wrong. Feel free to send me bug reports if you find something that
looks&nbsp;wrong.</p>

on the Microsoft SharePoint team blog about Content Deployment, a feature I work on. Take a look if you&#8217;re interested&#8230; This is the kind of thing that&#8217;s causing me never to update this&nbsp;site&#8230;</p>
