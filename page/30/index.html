<p><strong>Chapter 23: The&nbsp;Knot</strong></p>
<p>Joel felt disoriented. Where was he? He glanced around the small, dimly-lit
room in which he found himself, trying to remember how he&#8217;d gotten there.
Light streamed in from a lone window to his left. Outside, the lush Sumatran
jungle glistened with morning dew. But he didn&#8217;t remember this place from his
travels. Where was&nbsp;he?</p>
<p>Standing up unsteadily, he looked down the length of room, searching for the
exit. He found none. The room was of a short width, about 15 feet, but
immensely long; it stretched out infinitesimally both in front and behind him.
The only perceptible light was from the window beside him, and he suck his
head out, peering around the landscape for signs of&nbsp;civilization.</p>
<p>The jungle stretched out for miles below him, and looking out either side of
the window revealed a plain exterior that stretched out at least as far as the
dark interior did. The building he was in was on a long plateau; looking down,
he realized that there would be no escaping through the window. The plateau
abruptly ended at the edge of the building and dropped straight down 30 or 40
meters. <em>So much for that plan</em>, he&nbsp;thought.</p>
<p>He stepped back into the dim inside of the building. Looking to his left, he
now noticed a dim flicker of light. “Hello? Is anyone there?” his voice echoed
eerily down the length of the room, but he received no&nbsp;response.</p>
<p>The flicker of light seemed to grow stronger, so he began to walk towards
it. The light from the window faded behind him as he moved on, and he
struggled to see anything around him. The light ahead seemed to be much
steadier now, so he continued towards it, driven by burning curiosity and a
strong desire to determine how he was going to get out of the room. Surely the
source of the light would hold some answers for&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>He blinked his eyes in the darkness, attempting to force them to adjust to
the near pitch-blackness of his surroundings, and when he opened them again,
he noticed a window, similar, if not identical, to the one he had passed some
time back. It hadn&#8217;t been there before&#8230; had it? How could he have missed it?
He ran up to it and looked out of it towards the jungle and to either side of
the building. The view was the same as before; the precipice below him, the
plain smooth sides of the building on either side, stretching out towards&nbsp;infinity.</p>
<p>The cool breeze was refreshing against his skin, moistened by perspiration
from his short hike through the stuffy interior of the building. He inhaled
deeply, letting the clear, humid air clear his lungs and his mind. How he
loved that feeling! The clear, warm air &#8211; such simple pleasures that you
simply couldn&#8217;t get back home in the&nbsp;city.</p>
<p>He reluctantly remove his head from the window and continued his journey
through the long room. The window&#8217;s light faded behind him, but then,
unexpectedly, another appeared in front of him. The pattern continued as he
journeyed endlessly&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>The flickering light grew more steady, but seemed to increase in size almost
imperceptibly. It occurred to Joel unexpectedly that perhaps he wasn&#8217;t moving
forward at all; the lack of substantial increase in the apparent size of the
light source ahead was less than encouraging. Somehow, though, he felt that
that light held the answer to his escape, so he pressed on towards it, despite
his&nbsp;doubts.</p>
<p>He continued on for what seemed like miles. Window after window appeared and
disappeared as he journeyed, but he ignored them, intent on making it to the
light, to the&nbsp;answer.</p>
<p>Then, without warning, as the windows had appeared, he blinked and he was
there. The light was coming from a solitary candle sitting on a low table.
Behind the table, deep in the shadows, sat an elderly man with a strange
looking cloth draped over his shoulder and in his lap. His features were
barely visible in the candlelight, and Joel stepped closer to examine&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>His long grey hair was unkempt and hung in long strings around his head,
further sheltering his face from Joel&#8217;s prying eyes. The man gazed intently at
the cloth in his lap, and Joel noticed his fingers working with expert
precision and the utmost care on the loose thin strings that spidered out from
the cloth. To the man&#8217;s left, Joel saw a roll of finished cloth &#8211; the man was
weaving it&nbsp;himself.</p>
<p>The pattern was intricate, and the thin strings the man handled shone with a
sparkle that Joel had never seen before. He was overcome with a desire to
touch the cloth, and he knelt down and placed his hand gently on the roll. It
was tremendously soft, and seemed to radiate a soft warmth as well as a gentle
shine. Joel longed to take the cloth and wrap himself in it&#8217;s comforting
warmth, but he was interrupted by the man&#8217;s quiet&nbsp;voice.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re not supposed to be here.” Joel started at the sound. He removed his
hand from the cloth quickly and looked at the man. He did not look up; his
gaze remained inextricably fastened to the work in front of&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>Joel gazed, transfixed, as the man reached back to the roll of cloth that
Joel had though finished and pulled a loose thread from the center of the
roll. He pulled it slowly and surely towards his lap; the thread seemed to
grow longer and longer as necessary until it reached his lap, where, with
quick indecipherable flicks of the wrist, he tied it to the strands he had
been presently working&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>A small smile crossed his face as he completed the knotting of the
collection of thin strings, and pushed the multicolored mass towards the
nearly completed line of cloth he held in his lap, guiding it slowly along the
black wire-like string to which they were all&nbsp;bound.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re not supposed to be here,” he spoke again, still not breaking his
steadfast&nbsp;gaze.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m sorry. I don&#8217;t know how I got here&#8230;” Joel responded unsteadily. The
man frowned as he grasped another two threads and tied a simple knot, binding
them&nbsp;together.</p>
<p>“This isn&#8217;t&nbsp;right&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Again, I don&#8217;t really know how I got here. If you could&nbsp;just&#8230;”</p>
<p>The man interrupted before Joel could continue, “You&#8217;ll need to&nbsp;go&#8230;”</p>
<p>Joel sighed, perplexed. Was the man not hearing him, or was he simply
ignoring him? “Well, if you&#8217;d just tell me how to get out, I&#8217;d gladly leave.
Could you tell me where the exit&nbsp;is?”</p>
<p>The man continued staring at his lap, a look of utter vexation on his face.
He pulled one of the threads from the collection that laid in front of him. As
he pulled on it, the end broke unexpectedly off, and the man held in his hand
a single thread unattached to the others. He raised his eyebrows and furrowed
his brow. “This isn&#8217;t&nbsp;right.”</p>
<p>Joel was confused. The man seemed o be totally ignoring everything he had to
say, totally engrossed in his own work. “What are you doing?” he asked.
Perhaps a direct approach would be more&nbsp;effective.</p>
<p>“Knots,” the man mumbled under his breath. Was it a response, or the
verbalization of a random thought by a crazy old man? It was clear to Joel
that the man was tying knots &#8211; he didn&#8217;t need to be schooled in the obvious,
he needed to be told how to get out of this endless&nbsp;room.</p>
<p>“Hmmm, yes, I&#8217;ll have to fix this&#8230;” the man continued mumbling under his
breath. “What to do&#8230; What to do?” Joel sympathized. He also wondered what he
should&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the man started smiling down at the mass of threads. He
grasped one of them by the end and pulled it up in front of his face, peering
into the swirling colors and light that seemed to emanate from&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Joel was enthralled by the string &#8211; what kind of cloth was it? As he peered
more closely at the thread, he noticed pictures reflecting on the man&#8217;s face
and the surrounding walls. The candlelight projected through the thread was
producing swirling images all around. Upon closer inspection, Joel noticed
himself in the pictures, which, he now noticed, were actually moving. They had
a home video quality to them; the colors were washed out, the overall picture
grainy, but his own image was&nbsp;unmistakable.</p>
<p>There he was at his sixth birthday party, when Afton Matthews had hit him
after he called her a doodoo-head. In another, he was arguing with Sara over
their breakup, pleading with her to reconsider. Then he was at St. Ig&#8217;s
presenting his solution to the Math Club&#8217;s weekly mathematical brain twister,
soaking in the incredulous looks of the other students at his mental
faculties. And then, in another, he was lying in his hospital bed, doctors
swarming over him, his parents standing outside, peering in the window&nbsp;frantically.</p>
<p>What was going on? He glanced back down at the man, who now held a small
pair of scissors open, prepared to cut the thread at it&#8217;s base, severing it&#8217;s
connection to the rest of the cloth. “Wait, what are you doing?” Joel cried
out as the man deftly snipped the thread&nbsp;free.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m sorry&#8230; this has to be done,” the man spoke softly. Joel felt a sudden
emptiness overcome him, and he collapsed to his knees. Joel felt as if his
body was disintegrating; he was wasting away rapidly. The pictures faded as
the man moved the now solitary thread away from the&nbsp;candlelight.</p>
<p>Joel fell prostrate on the floor and struggled to turn, facing the man. “Why
are you doing this?” he asked, aware that his own voice was
uncharacteristically low and&nbsp;raspy.</p>
<p>The man picked up the thread he had previously examined, and, apparently
finding what he was looking for, took the newly cut thread and tied them
together in a complicated knot, then fastened them to another thin black
thread that protruded out of the cloth, using an even more intricate&nbsp;joint.</p>
<p>Joel tried to cry out again, but no sound came. The man smiled broadly at
his work. “There, that should do it.” Joel continued his attempts to cry out
as everything disappeared from&nbsp;view.</p>
<hr />
<p>“What happened?” Doctor Ross said as he entered the&nbsp;room.</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t know,” Heather responded fearfully. “He just went into cardiac
arrest &#8211; there was no forewarning. He was awake and talking, then&nbsp;this!”</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>.” The doctor looked at the instruments along Joel&#8217;s bedside, then
examined his chart quickly. Nothing seemed to fit. Two orderly&#8217;s wheeled in a
portable defibrillator and heather ripped open the hospital gown covering
Joel&#8217;s&nbsp;chest.</p>
<p>The doctor barked almost incomprehensible orders and the nurses and
orderlies scrambled to fulfill them. As the defibrillator&#8217;s cold metal leads
were placed on his chest, Joel shot up in his bed, shouting maniacally, “What
are you&nbsp;doing?”</p>
<p>The hospital staff froze in confusion and amazement. Joel grabbed Heather&#8217;s
arm tightly and looked fiercely into her eyes. “I have to&nbsp;go.”</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 24:&nbsp;Search</strong></p>
<p>“Holly, I don&#8217;t see him anywhere. We&#8217;ve been up and down every street I can
think of and he&#8217;s just not&nbsp;here.”</p>
<p>“Well, we have to find him, Ned. We have&nbsp;to.”</p>
<p>Ned was frustrated. All Holly could say was “We have to find him,” but she
had no ideas as to how to go about doing just that. She just wanted to
continue driving around in circles until they stumbled upon him. At first, Ned
had humored her, but he was now convinced they weren&#8217;t going to find Ernie
this way. He wasn&#8217;t ready to give up &#8211; quite the opposite, in fact &#8211; but he
wanted to go back to St. Ives and talk to Rhonda, and see if she had any ideas
as to his whereabouts. Perhaps she knew some of the places Ernie went when he
didn&#8217;t stay at St.&nbsp;Ives.</p>
<p>But Holly would hear none of it. She refused to go back to St. Ives with
him; she wanted to stay out on the street &#8211; the whole night if they had to –
to find Ernie. Ned was puzzled by her complete reluctance to go to St. Ives.
She was not entirely without reason or logic, even in her excited state of
mind, but she refused to even entertain the idea, no matter how many times he
mentioned&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>But this was getting ridiculous. They weren&#8217;t getting anywhere, and
something had to be done. “Holly, I am going to St. Ives to talk to&nbsp;Rhonda.”</p>
<p>“Ned,” Holly protested. “I don&#8217;t want to go to St. Ives. He&#8217;s probably just
around the next alley&#8230; Come on, let&#8217;s&nbsp;check.”</p>
<p>She wasn&#8217;t going to get her way this time. “No. I am going to St. Ives, I&#8217;m
going to talk to Rhonda, and then we&#8217;ll decide what to do.” He spoke
definitively, and Holly turned her head and stared listlessly out the window
at the passing grayness of the&nbsp;outside.</p>
<p>She remained quiet throughout the rest of the drive, and Ned wondered if he
had permanently damaged their friendship. Still, it had to be done. Their goal
had to be to <em>find</em> Ernie, not to merely <em>look</em> for&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>As the looming stone structure of St. Ives came into view, Holly turned her
head away from the window and looked straight ahead. Her eyes closed as she
bent down at the waist, placing her hands under her thighs and whimpering&nbsp;softly.</p>
<p>It occurred to Ned, as he sat there observing her, how like his youngest
daughter she was acting. When his youngest didn&#8217;t get her way, she would often
sit down, wrap her arms around her body, and pout. Ned shook his head. The
difference between a three-year-old and a twenty-year-old weren&#8217;t that great
after&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>He pulled the van to a stop along the side of the nearly empty street and
prepared to get out, but as he opened the door, he noticed Holly was crying
again softly. He closed thee driver side door again and touched her shoulder&nbsp;gently.</p>
<p>“What&#8217;s wrong, Holly?” Her body shook convulsively as her tears overwhelmed
her. Ned kept his hand on her shoulder, and she gradually became calmer and
stopped shaking so&nbsp;much.</p>
<p>She pulled her head up from it&#8217;s position on her forearm and looked at Ned,
an expression of despair and immense pain on her face. “You know how I told
you I grew up in McAllister Park ?” she&nbsp;asked.</p>
<p>Ned nodded. They had had this conversation. She had told him she was born
and raised right here in this neighborhood. “Well, that&#8217;s not exactly true,”
she continued. I did spend a lot of time here when I was younger, but I was
really raised in a nice house out in the northwest&nbsp;suburbs.</p>
<p>“But when I was 8, my parents were in a car accident and both of them were
killed &#8211; I told you that; that is true. And I did get put in a foster home,
like I told you. Well, I actually got put in three or four different foster
homes. I didn&#8217;t adjust well to my parents&#8217; death, and I was a real wild&nbsp;child.</p>
<p>“When I was 16, I ran away fro my fourth foster family. I had planned to
move out west and build myself a new life out there, but I only made it as far
as McAllister Park .” She laughed hollowly. Ned looked intently at her and&nbsp;listened.</p>
<p>“Well, the neighborhood wasn&#8217;t too good, even back then, and things were
tough for me. I lived on the street, but being a woman, and a young one at
that, I dealt with a lot of shit. A kind old woman &#8211; Elsie was her name, I
think &#8211; brought me here, to St. Ives, one especially cold night, and I liked
it. It seemed to be perfect. Everyone was very friendly, they seemed to have
plenty of food, and there were warm&nbsp;beds.</p>
<p>“I especially liked John, the director of the shelter. He would sit and tell
me great stories, and he always listened to me when I talked. I honestly
thought I was in heaven. I thought I could get back on my feet, then I could
finish my trip out to California . Things were going to work&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>“I stayed there &#8211; or here, I guess &#8211; for a few days, and everything was
fine. But then I began to notice John touching my shoulder while I ate, or
rubbing his leg on mine while he sat next to me at mealtimes. He seemed to go
out of his way to find me, and he often asked me to come see him in his
office. Ordinarily, I wouldn&#8217;t have considered that a big deal, but the way he
was touching me was making me feel extremely uncomfortable, so I always found
an excuse, thankfully.” She paused, and Ned wondered if perhaps she wouldn&#8217;t
be able to or want to&nbsp;continue.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s all right if you don&#8217;t want to talk about it,” he&nbsp;said.</p>
<p>“No&#8230; I need to tell <em>someone</em>.” She took a deep breath, then continued.
“Usually we were in rooms with at least another woman, but one night, the
woman who I&#8217;d been staying with didn&#8217;t come back for the evening, so I was in
the little room alone. John came in late that night. I was asleep, and the
next thing I knew, I had a pillow over my head and somebody was groping at my
panties. I tried to scream, but the pillow covered it, and made it hard to
breathe&#8230;” She broke off, and Ned put his hand back on her shoulder. She
continued haltingly, tears welling up in her eyes&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t really know what happened &#8211; I think I tried to block it out. He was
on top of me&#8230; <em>raping</em> me&#8230; and I couldn&#8217;t do <em>anything</em>. He took off the
pillow because he ‘wanted to see my beautiful eyes,&#8217; but even then I couldn&#8217;t
do anything. Mentally, I wanted to scream and shout and twist and turn and
scratch, but no matter what my brain said, my body just sat there. I can still
remember the smell of the soup in the room, the muffled sound of the washing
machines down the hall, the feeling as he&#8230;” She broke off again, and Ned
strengthened his grip on her shoulder, hugging her shuddering body to&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>There they sat in silence for what seemed like hours, until Holly finally
pushed herself away from him. “I&#8217;m sorry&#8230; but even now I can&#8217;t bear the
thought of that place. I didn&#8217;t stay long after that night. John said if I
ever told anybody, no one would believe me. I guess he&#8217;s gone now, but the
memory&#8217;s still with&nbsp;me&#8230;”</p>
<p>Ned nodded. It made so much more sense now. He hated himself for bringing
her here, when she had asked &#8211; begged, even! &#8211; him not to. He hated himself
for recommending on a daily basis that she volunteer here, reminding her each
day of that terrible experience. What an idiot he&#8217;d&nbsp;been!</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m sorry,” he spoke quietly. “I shouldn&#8217;t have made you come&nbsp;here.”</p>
<p>Holly smiled wistfully. “Honestly, it feels kind of nice to finally tell
someone &#8211; someone who believes me that it happened &#8211; someone that cares. So
don&#8217;t beat yourself up over it. You couldn&#8217;t have known.” She looked out the
window at the large stone&nbsp;building.</p>
<p>“Well, since we&#8217;re here, you might as well go in and talk to&nbsp;Rhonda.”</p>
<p>Ned nodded and opened the driver door, stepping into the bitter cold of the
night. When he entered St. Ives, he found Rhonda in the kitchen, on the&nbsp;telephone.</p>
<p>“Missin&#8217; for 24 hours? Hell, he might be dead in 24 hours! There&#8217;s nothin&#8217;
can be done? <span class="caps">OK</span>. Thank you.” She hung up the phone angrily. “Can&#8217;t report
someone missin&#8217; ‘til they&#8217;ve been missin&#8217; 24 hours. Now that&#8217;s just&nbsp;stupid!”</p>
<p>She looked up, noticing Ned in the kitchen doorway. “Oh, sorry ‘bout that&#8230;
what can I do for ye?” Ned walked in and explained the whole story of their
search to her as she prepared them both a cup of&nbsp;tea.</p>
<p>“Wal, I&#8217;ve been feelin&#8217; a little strange myself &#8211; this isn&#8217;t the firs&#8217; time
Ernie hasn&#8217;t come back, but this time it seems different. I mean, he was out
last night, and I know that he wouldn&#8217;t let it happen two days in a row &#8211; he
knows I&#8217;d lay into him for dat.” She sighed and took another sip of her tea.
“But da police say dey can&#8217;t do anything yet. You say you&#8217;ve looked through
all the streets and alleys ‘round&nbsp;here?”</p>
<p>Ned nodded. Holly had insisted that they leave no stone uncovered. “Wal, I
don&#8217;t know then. I hope he&#8217;s all right. Give me your number. If I hear
anything or he shows up, I&#8217;ll give you a&nbsp;call.”</p>
<p>Ned wrote his number on the pad she handed him, thanked her for the tea, and
headed back out in the cold towards the van. Holly was staring anxiously out
of the window at the stone building as he&nbsp;approached.</p>
<p>“Did she have any ideas?” she asked as Ned closed the door and started the&nbsp;engine.</p>
<p>“No, but she said she&#8217;d call us if she heard anything or he appeared there.”
Holly looked disappointed, and Ned couldn&#8217;t blame her. He had hoped Rhonda
would have some ideas as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” Holly asked, as Ned turned back towards their main
search area instead of going straight back towards his&nbsp;home.</p>
<p>“Well, I figured we owed it to Ernie to check one more time. Maybe we missed
something.” Holly&nbsp;smiled.</p>
<p>The roads were as empty as they&#8217;d been during their previous search, and
there was still no sign of Ernie along any of the streets or the narrow
alleyways. They were disappointed, but neither of them had really expected to
find anything. They were both tired &#8211; it was time to call it a night and hope
for new developments in the&nbsp;morning.</p>
<p>“Ned, do you see that?” Holly asked, pointing up ahead at a shiny glint on
the street&nbsp;curb.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“What is&nbsp;it?”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t know&#8230; Probably a plastic bag or a hubcap or&nbsp;something.”</p>
<p>“Stop for a&nbsp;sec.”</p>
<p>Ned obeyed and jumped as Holly threw the passenger door open and hopped out,
running towards the glint up ahead. She returned a few seconds later, excited.
“Look, Ned!” she exclaimed, thrusting the object in her hand at Ned&#8217;s face. It
was Ernie&#8217;s&nbsp;Walkman.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 25:&nbsp;Fight</strong></p>
<p>When Mike came to he was alone in a small maintenance closet. He was no
longer tied to the chair, but the appearance of freedom was short lived. The
door to the closet was closed, and a quick test revealed it was locked as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>He sat down on the floor and waited, rubbing the back of his head gingerly.
He felt the telltale rough surface of the scab on the back of his skull where
the previous blows had broken the skin. His head was really taking a beating
today. Between the bouts of unconsciousness earlier in the day &#8211; had that just
been this morning? &#8211; and the more recent knocks given him by Angelo&#8217;s goons,
it was a wonder he was still&nbsp;standing.</p>
<p>He was standing, though, unsteadily. He leaned against the door, balancing
himself, waiting for the lightheadedness to pass. The swirling of his brain
cells slowly stopped, and he began to feel like his old self&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>The slightly muffled sound of cheering could be heard beyond the door. He
strained his hearing to focus on the sound, to pick up any specific sound that
might tell him something about what Angelo had in&nbsp;mind.</p>
<p>A man was speaking, his voice Angelo didn&#8217;t&nbsp;recognize.</p>
<p>“Well, folks, we have a very special event tonight. You know, normally we
try to encourage audience participation during the “battle,” as we like to
call it&#8230;” The crowd cheered again, louder than&nbsp;before.</p>
<p>The man continued, speaking loudly over the din of the crowd. “But&#8230; <span class="caps">BUT</span>
tonight, we have something special planned. I&#8217;d like to tell you about Mike –
he&#8217;s a guy just like you. He had a job downtown, he had a nice house, a nice
wife &#8211; things were great. But this morning, Mike got fired from his job&#8230;”
The crowd&nbsp;booed.</p>
<p>“When he got home, he found his wife in bed with another man.” The crowd
booed even more loudly, and Mike discerned several insults flying from their
mouths. “That bitch!” “Whore!”&nbsp;“Cunt!”</p>
<p>“But Mike didn&#8217;t sit back and take that shit, no! He fought back! He picked
up a baseball bat and beat the fucking shit out of that adulterous bastard,
and did a nasty number on his wife, too!” The crowd cheered maniacally and
some even clapped. Mike felt pretty good. He <em>had</em> done the right thing,
after all. What else could he have done? Finally he was getting some
recognition for the hard work he&#8217;d put in, for the talent that he had nurtured
and developed over countless&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>The door to the closet opened unexpectedly, and Angelo stood there, backed
by two large sullen-looking men. He looked Mike up and down, and smiled&nbsp;cryptically.</p>
<p>“Looking good, Mike. Have you heard what they&#8217;re saying about you? Mike, I&#8217;m
telling you, this is the place for you. The guys here <em>love</em> you! Listen to
‘em!” He motioned down the hall where the sound of the crowd grew louder
again. “Now let&#8217;s go and show ‘em why you&#8217;re king shit of fuck&nbsp;mountain.”</p>
<p>Mike hated Angelo, but the sound of that crowd was incredibly enticing. They
were now shouting his name. “Mike&#8230; Mike&#8230;&nbsp;Mike&#8230;”</p>
<p>“You really want to see him? You want to see him fight some degenerate
bastard?” The crowd cheered even more, and the chant of his name grew more
powerful. Mike felt good. They wanted him. They needed him. The rage from the
day&#8217;s events came rushing back, and he smashed his fist against the closet
door&nbsp;impulsively.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s right,” Angelo smirked. “Tap into that anger. You have a right to,
after what those bastards have done to you. Go show ‘em all why you&#8217;re a bad-
ass motherfucker.” Angelo stepped aside and motioned down the hall. Mike
hadn&#8217;t heard him. He was focused on the chanting from the&nbsp;crowd.</p>
<p>He followed the noise into the large room. There must have been hundreds of
men there, all shouting for him. The announcer glanced over his shoulder, and
seeing Mike behind him, turned back to the raucous crowd and announced his&nbsp;arrival.</p>
<p>“Here he is, Mike Turner!” The crowd shouted in frenzied excitement, and
Mike stepped forward confidently. He didn&#8217;t feel like himself &#8211; he felt more
powerful. He felt like a hulking menace, a “bad-ass motherfucker,” as Angelo
had termed it, and he was going to give these fans a&nbsp;show.</p>
<p>He stepped out in the center clearing and the announcer stepped back,
allowing the circle of excited faces to close around him. Mike looked around
at the faces. The men were mostly dressed in suits, and all looked to be about
30 or 40 years old. Their faces were tired, but a maniacal frenzy shone in
their eyes, and they cheered, clapped and shouted as Mike raised his right
hand above his head, fist closed defiantly. They were not unlike him &#8211; they
were his peers. And he commanded their respect. Every man in that room wanted
to be him at that moment, and the ceaseless applause confirmed&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>He turned around 360 degrees, hand still in the air, letting each and every
member of the crowd survey their new god. Their look of awe was magnificently
boosting his ego, and any qualms he had about participating in something
Angelo had suggested and sanctioned were now only distant considerations. He
had killed a man, and tonight, he&#8217;d kill&nbsp;another.</p>
<p>Much more than at any other point in his life, Mike knew that this was his
destiny. This was his purpose, his reason for existence. Everything up until
this night was preparation &#8211; the shaping of his temper, his nightly boxing
workout to funnel away the constant anger he felt, the events of the past day
– they had all prepared him to find himself. And when all was revealed, there
was no sign of Mike Turner, the man. There was only Mike Turner, the <em>animal
</em>.</p>
<p>He was primal, he was brutal, he was everything that Angelo had said he was.
And this was his arena &#8211; his home. This battleground was the place where he
would complete the transformation. But to do that, he would need an opponent.
Where was the man these joker&#8217;s had found to fight&nbsp;him?</p>
<p>He wheeled around, searching for the man he would soon kill. The crowd
parted, and a man was pushed roughly into the right side of the circle. He
stood there unsteadily, peering out from behind thick&nbsp;glasses.</p>
<p>This was the man they had selected for Mike to fight? <em>This</em> was him, this
scared, shaking man with geeky glasses? For a moment, Mike felt slighted. As
psychotically driven as he was, he probably could kill a man twice his size,
maybe even ten men, and they had found this little&nbsp;bastard.</p>
<p>The crowd&#8217;s shouting and cheering would not let him object, however; he&#8217;d
have to fight the man, no matter how small or insignificant he was. This fight
would be easy. He&#8217;d win their favor, then they&#8217;d send him someone greater,
someone more powerful to fight the next time. But this man would need to be
killed, of that Mike was&nbsp;certain.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ernie was confused. He had been unconscious until his abductors had pulled
him out of the car trunk and waved some strange-smelling stuff in front of his
nose. They had pulled him roughly into some building and held him firmly in a
small hallway. He could hear loud shouting&nbsp;ahead.</p>
<p>Then, without warning, the two men holding him pushed through a mass of
bodies and threw him out into a large circle, facing another man who paced in
a frenzy around the outside of the circle, his fist raised above his&nbsp;head.</p>
<p>His glasses were foggy from the warm humidity in the building, but he dared
not remove them to wipe them off. He was frightened beyond reason, and he
didn&#8217;t want to risk the blindness that would come with the removal of his
glasses. He had to be able to see&nbsp;everything.</p>
<p>The man across from him lowered his arm when he noticed Ernie. His eyes were
crazed and bloodthirsty, and Ernie got the distinct impression from his look
that he was not in the mood to make&nbsp;friends.</p>
<p>The man sidestepped towards him slowly. Ernie was unsure what to do, but he
didn&#8217;t want to get in the man&#8217;s way. All he wanted to do was get away. He
turned and tried to get out through mass of bodies that now blocked the path
through which he had entered the circle, but the men there laughed and grabbed
him pushing him back into the&nbsp;center.</p>
<p>As he turned his head, his jaw met with the man&#8217;s fist, sending him
sprawling to the floor. His glasses clattered on the concrete alongside him.
The man towered over him menacingly, silently daring him to get up. Ernie
didn&#8217;t want to, but the man&#8217;s fists were less damaging weapons than his feet,
so against his will, he forced himself to stand&nbsp;again.</p>
<hr />
<p>Mike had been right about his opponent. There was very little resistance. He
had initially tried to turn and run, but the circle of fans had sportingly
prevented <em>that</em>. Mike had taken the opportunity to run up behind him
quickly, and planted his first punch squarely on the man&#8217;s jaw. It had been a
clean punch, a powerful one, and the man had crumpled to the floor under his&nbsp;strength.</p>
<p>Mike grinned and stepped towards the man, raising his hand at the crowd
again, proclaiming his strength. The man looked up fearfully, bleary-eyed
without his glasses, tears streaming from his&nbsp;eyes.</p>
<p>Mike ignored him completely, and as the man struggled to stand again, on all
fours, Mike planted a swift kick to his stomach, eliciting a gasp and low moan
as the man went down&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>Mike diabolically repeated the cycle, following the man as he crawled around
the circle, trying to find means of escape. Sometimes he&#8217;d let the man stand,
then punch him down to the floor again, other times he&#8217;d kick viciously while
the man stood moaning on the ground. Blood was now everywhere, and the sight
of the maroon flow only increased the crowd&#8217;s agitation and Mike&#8217;s&nbsp;frenzy.</p>
<p>He was no longer himself. His sole purpose was to beat the pure existence
out of this man. The crowd pulsated at every punch, every kick, and he drew
power from their yells and shouted&nbsp;encouragement.</p>
<p>At one crowd member&#8217;s shouted suggestion, he kicked the man&#8217;s head, hard,
while he lay on the ground. The neck whipped back with a satisfying crack, and
the man&#8217;s body curled up, motionless. He made no attempt to rise this time.
The crowd crooned&nbsp;approvingly.</p>
<p>Mike stood over the man&#8217;s limp, crumpled body, his bare muscled back
glistening magnificently under the fluorescent lights of the warehouse. The
circle of men chanted methodically. “Finish him&#8230; Finish him&#8230;” Mike looked
up the faces around him. They were crying for finality, for annihilation, for
blood, and he would give it to them. This was it. He had finally found it.
This was his shining&nbsp;moment.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 26:&nbsp;Crash</strong></p>
<p>“ Just where are we going, son?” Joel&#8217;s father seemed puzzled by his son&#8217;s
strange request to leave the hospital and drive off somewhere, but he knew his
son well enough to not ask too many questions; Joel wouldn&#8217;t flip out like he
had about anything that wasn&#8217;t&nbsp;important.</p>
<p>Joel wished he could answer his dad, but he honestly didn&#8217;t know where they
were going. He had woken up in the hospital with an uncontrollable urge to get
up, leave the hospital, and drive somewhere, <em>anywhere</em>. His mother, not to
mention the doctors, had all protested valiantly, but in the end his father,
sensing the urgency that Joel was attempting to communicate, had volunteered
to take his son where he felt he needed to go, and had successfully silenced
the&nbsp;doctors.</p>
<p>But his faith in his son was thinning as they drove on aimlessly. Joel was
unable to give any concrete information about their destination, instead
giving last-second directions, forcing him to make hairpin turns and nearly
flipping their old station wagon over several times. But the urgency on Joel&#8217;s
face never&nbsp;wavered.</p>
<p>Joel looked intently out the window, waiting for the next spur of intuition
that would prompt another turn. He thought back on the fading memory of the
dream &#8211; is that what it was? &#8211; and of the man with the threads, weaving the
cloth. What had it all meant? His father had told him that his heart had
stopped suddenly in the hospital, for no apparent reason, but Joel felt fine
now. In fact, the pain in his side was almost non-existent, though the bloody
piece of gauze taped tightly to his side served as a reminder of his&nbsp;injury.</p>
<p>He had a suspicion that there was more to his dream than normal. Something
about it felt final, like he was supposed to learn something from it. And the
feeling of complete emptiness when the man had cut the thread&#8230; He glanced
down as the memory of that feeling returned; no, there was no hole in his
stomach, thank&nbsp;God.</p>
<p>He finally answered his father, “I don&#8217;t know,&nbsp;Dad.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t know where we&#8217;re&nbsp;going.”</p>
<p>“Ummm, <span class="caps">OK</span>&#8230; Well, just try to give me a little more warning with the turns,
all&nbsp;right?”</p>
<p>Joel smiled. His dad hated driving anything more than the speed limit; their
breakneck speed and last minute turns could not be good for his nerves.
“Thanks for doing this,&nbsp;Dad.”</p>
<p>His father smiled wryly. “Well, it&#8217;s not like you gave me&nbsp;much&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Right! Turn right!” Joel shouted suddenly, bracing himself against his seat
as his father complied. The tires screeched angrily, and the drivers behind
them honked as they screamed by, seemingly balanced on two&nbsp;wheels.</p>
<p>“&#8230;choice. It&#8217;s not like you gave me much choice,” his father continued
haltingly as they bounced along the narrow side street Joel had directed them&nbsp;onto.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Joel said sheepishly. He didn&#8217;t even really know why he had yelled
to turn &#8211; it just sort of came out. Well, hopefully it would all make sense
once they arrived at their destination, where ever it&nbsp;was.</p>
<hr />
<p>Cobb and Ames were on their way to Delome when the call came in over the
radio. “Unit 402&#8230; Cobb, Ames , you&nbsp;there?”</p>
<p>It was Foster. Ames picked up the radio transmitter and responded. “Yeah,
Foster, we&#8217;re here. What&#8217;s&nbsp;up?”</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s some trouble over on Delome&#8230; You guys are headed there,&nbsp;right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we&#8217;re on our way right&nbsp;now.”</p>
<p>“Well pick it up. There&#8217;s somethin&#8217; wrong over there. <span class="caps">OC</span> called and said
they can&#8217;t raise either of the blue and whites on the radio, and Mrs. Riley,
the old woman that had been calling to complain, called in and said that the
noise was louder than it had ever been before. He said it sounded like a war
was goin&#8217; on over there. You&#8217;re the closest unit we&#8217;ve got, so step on it.
We&#8217;re sending backup &#8211; be&nbsp;careful.”</p>
<p>“You&#8217;ve got it, Lieutenant.” Ames hung up the radio receiver and looked at
Cobb. “Well, you heard her partner. Let&#8217;s go.” Cobb flipped on the siren and
lights, and, as instructed, floored the&nbsp;accelerator.</p>
<hr />
<p>Neither Joel nor his father even saw the other car zooming into the
intersection. They had heard the siren approaching behind them, and had pulled
as far as possible to the right as the cop car passed them, speeding into the&nbsp;intersection.</p>
<p>Joel&#8217;s father, monitoring the fla shing lights in his left-side mirror, had
not noticed the red light in the Franklin &#8211; Niles intersection until it was
too late. Suddenly the left side of station wagon crumpled with a magnificent
screeching sound, and the world was spinning around&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Joel felt weightless for a moment, then felt searing pain in his legs as
they were crushed in a mass of metal. His head bounced viciously against the
top of the station wagon as the huge vehicle spun out of control, and finally
came to a scrapping stop, upside down on the far side of the intersection.
Joel looked over at his father, whose head was slumped back against the
headrest, cuts and scrapes on his face and neck. He wasn&#8217;t&nbsp;moving.</p>
<p>Cold air rushed in from the windows, now free of glass. Joel tried to speak,
but everything was silent. His ears were ringing; he couldn&#8217;t hear anything;
the entire world seemed to move in silent slow motion, like a Charlie Chaplin
film at half&nbsp;speed.</p>
<p>He became aware of movement outside the car. Strange upside-down people came
running towards the car. Faces peered in both windows, shouting something at
him, but he couldn&#8217;t hear them above the ringing in his&nbsp;ears.</p>
<p>His unexplainable sense of purpose, which had driven him to rise from the
hospital bed and brought his father out here along with him, was now gone. He
just wanted to sleep. Couldn&#8217;t these people see he just wanted to rest? With a
wave of his hand, he dismissed the faces and closed his eyes, beckoning sleep
to come as his door opened and strong hands pulled him out of the&nbsp;car.</p>
<hr />
<p>Cobb sat dazed in the driver seat of the car as it came to a stop, having
completed a full 360 degree spin, facing the direction it had initially been
headed. “Holy shit!” he said under his brea th. He looked over at Ames , who
was clutching the dashboard with white-knuckled hands, a breathing hard and
looking straight ahead,&nbsp;wide-eyed.</p>
<p>“Holy shit is right&#8230;” Ames responded, peeling his hands from the dashboard
and looking back over his shoulder at the wreckage behind them. The blue fla
shing lights cast at eerie glow over the whole&nbsp;scene.</p>
<p>Cars on either side of the intersection had stopped, doors hanging open as
motorists stepped out and ran towards the vehicles to offer what assistance
they&nbsp;could.</p>
<p>Cobb and Ames now had a dilemma. Ordinarily, their purpose would have been
clear; they would have exited their vehicle and gone back to the scene of the
accident, offering whatever help they could. But in this case, there was also
a developing situation down on Del ome that also required their attention. It
was not immediately clear what they should do, and in fact, either choice
would no doubt leave them with a disciplinary&nbsp;inquiry.</p>
<p>Ames decided that the other motorists had the accident covered. Ames &#8216; and
Cobb&#8217;s presence would only add more confusion to the scene. He picked up the
radio and motioned for the still-stunned Cobb to move&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>“Dispatch, this is unit 402, we&#8217;ve got an accident at the Franklin &#8211; Niles
intersection. Looks pretty bad, send ambulances and road clearing equipment.
Officers leaving the scene in pursuit of another possible&nbsp;crime.”</p>
<p>“Ten four, unit 402, ambulances are on their&nbsp;way.”</p>
<p>“Hope everybody&#8217;s all right,” Cobb muttered as he sped up again, continuing
on towards the ind ustrial section of&nbsp;town.</p>
<p>“Not much else we could do. I have a feeling something is wrong with those
blue and whites, and even if we&#8217;d stayed, the ambulances would have taken just
as long to get&nbsp;there.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know, but it seems wrong to just leave them there, you&nbsp;know.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Let&#8217;s hope whatever&#8217;s going on down here is worth&nbsp;it.”</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 27:&nbsp;Takedown </strong></p>
<p>Angelo had a problem. That bitch old woman from down the street had been
calling the cops again, and not one, but <em>two</em> blue and whites were running
along the street, looking for signs of&nbsp;trouble.</p>
<p>There was no way he could stop the fight now. The crowd was in too much of a
frenzy, and Mike was doing a hell of a job beating this guy to a pulp. It was
true magic, and if Angelo hadn&#8217;t been so preoccupied with dealing with the law
enforcement threat, he would have enjoyed watching the fight&nbsp;himself.</p>
<p>But now, he stood pacing in front of four bound and gagged city cops,
wondering what he should do. He had sent out several of his best men to grab
the cops before they could call for backup, but he couldn&#8217;t be sure they had
succeeded entirely, and even if they had, it wouldn&#8217;t be long until backup
would show up anyway, since no one was responding to the radio&nbsp;calls.</p>
<p>Shit! Why tonight? Mike was giving them the show of a lifetime out there –
he&#8217;d bring in at least <em>double</em> the normal attendance next week! But he&#8217;d
probably have to stop the fight early. He couldn&#8217;t risk getting shut down at
this point, and he had little doubt that more cops were on their&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>He motioned to the men who stood guard over the bound officers, and they all
stepped out of the small closet room, closing and locking the door behind&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>, here&#8217;s what I want you to do&#8230; Go around quietly to the outside of the
fight circle and let people know cops are on their way. It won&#8217;t take long for
word to get around. People&#8217;ll start clearin&#8217; out on their own. I&#8217;m getting&#8217;
out of&nbsp;here.”</p>
<p>“What about the guy?” one of the men asked, motioning towards the arena
where Mike stood hunched over, delivering vicious blows to Ernie&#8217;s back and&nbsp;skull.</p>
<p>“Leave ‘im. We don&#8217;t have time to deal with ‘im right now.” It was a pity,
really, since Mike had already shown such promise, but Angelo didn&#8217;t have much
choice at this point. Mike was crazed &#8211; out of his mind &#8211; right now. It would
take him too long to cool down enough to be lucid. Angelo couldn&#8217;t take the
risk of being anywhere near here when the cops showed&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>His men ran off to follow his directions, and he turned, Marty close behind,
towards the door where his car waited outside. He shot one glance back towards
the arena, where Mike&#8217;s latest maneuver elicited another scream of approval
from the frenzied crowd. _What a shame.&nbsp;_</p>
<hr />
<p>As Cobb and Ames made the final turn towards the industrial section, they
noticed several cars moving quickly towards the highway, headed the opposite
direction. “Looks like we missed the party,” Ames commented, taking note of
the frantic, frightened look on the face of one of the drivers as he passed&nbsp;by.</p>
<p>“Not quite,” Cobb responded. “Look.” He pointed ahead to a warehouse on the
left side of the street. Faint light streamed from the windows, and men in
business suits and loose ties poured out of the doors, scrambling over each
other towards lots on either side of the building, where their cars sat,
obscured behind overgrown weeds and&nbsp;shrubbery.</p>
<p>“Well, somethin&#8217;s been goin&#8217; on,” Ames commented, drawing his gun from his
waist and preparing to jump out of the car at a moment&#8217;s&nbsp;notice.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m going to pull up to the back,” Cobb said, turning the steering wheel
expertly to the left. “There&#8217;s no way we&#8217;re gonna take all these guys by
ourselves. Let&#8217;s go in the back and see if we can find out what&#8217;s going on.
There&#8217;s gotta be somethin&#8217; going on in&nbsp;there.”</p>
<p>Ames nodded as he checked the barrel on his gun again. He was&nbsp;ready.</p>
<p>Cobb pulled the car to a screeching halt and the detectives threw both doors
open, pumped out, and ran to the back door, one on either side of it, backs
pressed against the wall. Ames nodded, and Cobb turned and kicked the door in
with a crash. Ames followed him into the building, gun held ahead of him at
the&nbsp;ready.</p>
<p>They moved quickly through the small labyrinth of office and maintenance
rooms, checking for anyone or anything, but no one was&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>They eventually came to the small hallway which led to the main area of the
warehouse. Light crept under the closed double doors leading into the room,
and from their position they could hear echoic footsteps a man shouting.
“Wait! Where are you going? What the hell do you think you&#8217;re doing? Get back
here! You&#8217;re missing the fuckin&#8217; grand&nbsp;finale!”</p>
<p>They stepped through the heavy doors and saw a man, bare-chested, covered in
a sheen of perspiration and grit, standing over a bloody mess of a man, a
crazed look in his eyes, shouting at the opposite side of the room, where the
swinging doors indicated the last of the spectators had recently&nbsp;departed.</p>
<p>“Freeze!&nbsp;Police!”</p>
<hr />
<p>Mike&#8217;s audience was gone. Out of the corner of his eye, he had seen the
exodus begin. Someone had yelled, “The cops are coming!” With that, the entire
room had turned into a stampede of suits, each one heading for the door as
fast as he&nbsp;could.</p>
<p>Mike was surprised and annoyed that they were such pussies. The cops? What
could they do to him? He was fuckin&#8217; invincible! He could take a whole army of
cops on himself, none of the men would have to worry at all &#8211; he could protect&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>He shouted at them to stay, to watch his finale, to observe his final
crushing of the man beneath his foot, but his words fell on deaf ears. When
the last of the men passed through the double doors to the cold night outside,
he became aware of movement behind&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>“Freeze! Po lice!” He turned and eyed the two men warily. Were they serious?
<em>This</em> was who&#8217;d been sent to take <em>him</em> on? They leveled their guns on him
and repeated their&nbsp;warnings.</p>
<p>Mike looked down at the mess below him. He had done quite a job. Angelo had
been right when he had called him an artist. The blood smeared across the
cold, dusty concrete from his opponent&#8217;s escape attempts did remind him of a
Jackson Pollack&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>He leveled his eyes with the two police officers in front of him. They
continued to yell at him, but he ignored them. He was invincible, right? Fuck
them! They&#8217;d pay, just like everyone else&nbsp;had.</p>
<p>With that thought he screamed his battle cry and ran towards them, sweat,
blood, and dirt sliding off of him and landing in miniature puddles on the
floor behind him. He was an ancient warrior, an animal, the personification of
rage, brutality incarnate. None would stand in his&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>The first bullet struck him on his right side, and threw him slightly off
balance, but the second bullet struck his left side, restoring his balance.
Was this the best they could do? He barreled on, until the third, fourth, and
fifth bullets whizzed through his chest. He was vaguely aware of the small
explosions of blood that erupted as they pierced his skin, and he faltered.
His mind willed his legs to continue their motion, their support of his body,
but they&nbsp;refused.</p>
<p>He fell on the floor in front of the detectives, sliding forward as far as
the force of his momentum would carry him, and ended in a heap of crumpled
humanity at the feet of the&nbsp;detectives.</p>
<p>His chest heaved, and he willed himself to rise up, to destroy these
bastards, but his body refused, and he exhaled once in final defeat before his
body ceased to move at&nbsp;all.</p>

                                    <p>I really should be writing my novel right now, since it is due in six days and
I still have quite a bit to write, but this is just too cool. I heard about it
on the radio yesterday, and I wish I&#8217;d heard about it sooner, because I would
have ordered a turducken for Thanksgiving, instead of buying a bunch of fried
chicken from Popeye&#8217;s, which is what I am probably going to do. What is a
turducken, you ask? Only the <strong>coolest</strong> thing ever known to man: It&#8217;s a
boneless chicken stuffed in a bonless duck, stuffed in a boneless turkey. The
whole thing is stuffed with Cajun sausage, I believe. I should have known
something this awesome would come from the Cajun culture. Anyway, you can
actually purchase them online at <a href="http://www.cajungrocer.com/product_info.php?cPath=15_24&amp;products_id=340">CajunGrocer.com</a>, which I plan to do as
soon as the holiday is over. I&#8217;ll let you know how it goes. My mouth is

                                    <p><strong>Chapter 21: The&nbsp;Mark</strong></p>
<p>Ames and Cobb were excited. Joel had been able to give them a description,
albeit a rather poor one, but he&#8217;d also been able to give them a rough sketch
of the tattoo the man had on his hand, and <em>that</em> was something that they
could look&nbsp;into.</p>
<p>They ignored the dagger-like stares of Joel&#8217;s parents as they stood up
quickly, their movements taking on an almost frenzied speed, and rushed out of
the room, murmuring thanks to Joel as they went. Joel was just glad to be rid
of them. The pain had returned, and he was overcome with weakness again. Sleep
overcame him as Karen wordlessly maneuvered the notebook from his hands and
walked briskly out of the room, trying to catch up to Ames and&nbsp;Cobb.</p>
<p>Ames had a feeling that he had seen the mark before, but he couldn&#8217;t
remember where. Maybe if he looked at it again&#8230; Wait, where was the&nbsp;sketch?</p>
<p>“Damn it, Cobb, we forgot the sketch.” They both turned and nearly bowled
over a panting Karen, who thrust the note book at them. Cobb and Ames smiled.
“Thanks Karen. See you back at the&nbsp;station.”</p>
<p>They turned and continued out of the hospital and on to their car. Ames took
the passenger seat and examined the sketch more closely as Cobb started the
engine and headed out of the parking lot, turning towards the&nbsp;station.</p>
<p>“Recognize something, Ames ? ” Cobb asked, amused at his partner&#8217;s look of
complete perplexity as he peered at the&nbsp;sketch.</p>
<p>Ames sighed and reluctantly moved his eyes away from the sketch. “I dunno.
It looks so familiar.” He shook his head. “But I can&#8217;t put my finger on it
right now.” He rubbed his eyes and leaned his head back against the&nbsp;headrest.</p>
<p>“What a day. I&#8217;ll be glad when we can get some rest. What time is it,&nbsp;anyway?”</p>
<p>Cobb glanced at the green clock in the dash. “&#8217;Bout 4:30,” he said. “No rest
‘til we get this thing straightened out though &#8211; I&#8217;ve got a feeling we&#8217;re on
to something. We need to finish this out as soon as we can. This is a make-it-
or-break-it case for us, you&nbsp;know?”</p>
<p>Ames gave a low snore as a response, and Cobb smiled. Might as well let him
sleep for the few minutes it would take them to get to the station. It would
hopefully clear his head enough to help him remember where he&#8217;d seen the
tattoo&nbsp;before.</p>
<p>The station was clearing out when they arrived. It was quitting time for
many of the administrative workers, and the parking lot was becoming deserted
as they pulled&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>Their first stop was Foster&#8217;s office. She was on the phone when they&nbsp;entered.</p>
<p>“I understand that, Mrs. Mendocino. I will speak to them. Of course. If you
have any other concerns, please just give me a call. I know&#8230; you&#8217;ll be the
first to know. And if your son happens to think of anything else, please let
us know. <span class="caps">OK</span>, you have a nice day, and I am sorry about your son&#8230; Bye&nbsp;bye.”</p>
<p>Foster exhaled slowly as she laid the handset down. “That was Joel
Mendocino&#8217;s mother. She was upset because you stormed in and disturbed her
son.” She looked up at them pleadingly. “Was it really necessary to barge in
there like you&nbsp;did?”</p>
<p>“We ran into a complete dead end, Lieu. We figgered the kid could probably
give us more information than he already had, and based on other things we
were able to find out, we think this case may be bigger than just a simple&nbsp;mugging.”</p>
<p>“Really? What have you&nbsp;found?”</p>
<p>Both Cobb and Ames pulled out their notebooks, scanning the cluttered pages
for reminders of the day&#8217;s conversations. “Well, we got confirmation that the
dead victim <em>is</em> homeless. His name is Darryl; we weren&#8217;t able to get a last
name. He&#8217;s in and out of St. Ives, a homeless shelter down around McAllister
Park&nbsp;.”</p>
<p>Ames continued, “We went and talked to a number of homeless people in the
area, especially down on 59 th , and they all told us stories of some
‘abductions,&#8217; for lack of a better word, of homeless people these lat few
weeks. Seems they all show up a day later, all beat up. Apparently it happened
to Darryl, but no one we spoke to could tell us if it somehow related to his&nbsp;death.”</p>
<p>Ames paused, and Cobb interjected again. “Both of us feel like the
abductions and Darryl&#8217;s death are related, but we&#8217;re not sure how&nbsp;yet&#8230;”</p>
<p>“But this,” Ames said, slamming the sketchbook down on Foster&#8217;s desk
excitedly. “May be the link between everything. Joel Mendocino was able to
sketch this for us. He said that the man who&#8217;d shot him had that symbol
tattooed on his&nbsp;hand.”</p>
<p>Foster held the sketch up to the light, examining it more closely. She
frowned. “You said there have been a lot of abductions&nbsp;lately?”</p>
<p>Ames nodded. “Is it possible that Darryl told someone a little too much
about his experience and they had to have him&nbsp;killed?”</p>
<p>Cobb smiled. “That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re&nbsp;thinking.”</p>
<p>“Well, check with Organized Crime,” Foster said, handing the sketch back to
Ames . “See if the sketch rings any bells with them. If these abductions are
related, then there&#8217;s probably a kingpin involved somewhere along the line. <span class="caps">OC</span>
might know something about&nbsp;it.”</p>
<p>Ames and Cobb nodded before turning and exiting the office, walking to their
own desks in the main office. The station was still populated, but the usual
bustle of the day had calmed down substantially since everyone had gone&nbsp;home.</p>
<p>Cobb picked up his phone and dialed the extension for the Organized Crime
division as Ames headed back towards the records room. “Hi, this is Detective
Cobb from Homicide. We got a victim over here, homeless man, possibly related
to a rash of abductions and assaults that&#8217;s been happening recently in the
McAllister Park area. One of the shooters had a mark on his hand. We&#8217;ve got a
sketch, and we were wondering if you guys could take a look and see if you
recognize it. Sure. <span class="caps">OK</span>, I&#8217;ll do it right&nbsp;now.”</p>
<p>He out down the receiver. “They want me to fax it over.” He walked over to
the fax machine and fed the paper quickly through. Ames returned carrying a
stack of folders and sat down, poring through&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>“These are reports from some of the other assaults that have been reported
by hospitals recently. Most of them are from McAllister Park , which isn&#8217;t
surprising in and of itself, but here&#8217;s something interesting. There are other
reports of assault-like wounds from some middle-aged businessmen from the same
day or the day following the same report from a homeless man.&nbsp;Coincidence?”</p>
<p>Cobb glanced over Ames &#8216; shoulder at the cluttered data in front of them.
“So what are you&nbsp;thinking?”</p>
<p>“I dunno. But it seems strange to me that a bunch of businessmen get beat
up, and a bunch of homeless men get beat up, all at the same time, and nobody
wants to press charges or talk about it. Hell, a lot of them made excuses
like, ‘I fell down the stairs,&#8217; or some bullshit like&nbsp;that.”</p>
<p>The phone rang, shattering their contemplation. Cobb picked up. “This is
Cobb. Uh-huh. Really? So soon, huh? Great. Yeah, fax it over. You say there&#8217;s
a unit over in the area right now? <span class="caps">OK</span>, yeah, I&#8217;ll do that. <span class="caps">OK</span>, thanks a lot.&nbsp;Bye.”</p>
<p>Ames looked up from his reading&nbsp;excitedly.</p>
<p>“Well, we got a match,” Cobb said, walking over to the fax machine, where a
copy of a police report was spitting out. “The <span class="caps">OC</span> guys said there&#8217;s an
warehouse over on Delome that has been investigated by some blue and whites
for the past couple of weeks. A woman has been calling to complain about noise
coming from it for awhile, but by the time the blue and whites get out there,
there&#8217;s nothing to be&nbsp;seen.”</p>
<p>“But how does this tie into the tattoo, and what does <span class="caps">OC</span> have to do with it?
And furthermore, what&#8217;s a woman doing <em>living</em> down on&nbsp;Delome?”</p>
<p>Cobb chuckled. The old industrial section of the city centered around Delome
Avenue , and it was generally considered to be one of the worst places in the
city to live, but some residents refused to&nbsp;move.</p>
<p>“Well, <span class="caps">OC</span> started looking into it because there was a major <span class="caps">OC</span>-related drug
bust around the area, and they&#8217;re thinking the entire area is probably used by
gangs and whatnot for all kinds of nefarious activities. So they had a few of
their guys look into it, and he remembers seeing a symbol sort of like the
tattoo on the shooter&#8217;s hand etched into a door on one of the warehouses. They
sent a blue and white out there tonight to keep an eye on things, and see if
they could figure out what&#8217;s going on. What do you say we join&nbsp;‘em.”</p>
<p>“Worth a shot, I guess. Strange that a mark like that would be etched in a
door, but whatever. Thank God for small miracles, I suppose. Let&#8217;s&nbsp;go.”</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 22:&nbsp;Disappearance</strong></p>
<p>The silence that had followed James&#8217; story was finally broken by Holly&#8217;s
expression of thanks. She stood up slowly, reaching her hand towards the
grizzled&nbsp;storyteller.</p>
<p>“Thank you, James, for telling us about&nbsp;this.”</p>
<p>“Wal, I figgered somebody oughtta know. Somethin&#8217;s got to be done, I think.
I mean, most folks don&#8217;t seem to care too much about us down here, but still,
it just ain&#8217;t right for us to get kidnapped and beat up like we do. Anyway, I
hope maybe you all can tell the right&nbsp;people&#8230;”</p>
<p>Holly smiled as she released his hand. Ned nodded in acknowledgement and
thanks as he and Holly turned around, looking for Ned and Ken. They weren&#8217;t
sitting behind them where they had been initially. Where had they&nbsp;gone?</p>
<p>Holly glanced around frantically and began to call Ernie&#8217;s name. Ned calmed
her down. “Holly&#8230; maybe they&#8217;ve just gone to the van&#8230; let&#8217;s just go and
look.” He took her hand and led her towards the van. Holly wasn&#8217;t calm. The
stress of the day was finally catching up to her. She needed a stiff drink –
<em>very</em>&nbsp;stiff.</p>
<p>And now Ernie had disappeared! Her emotional side had taken over, leaving
rationality by the wayside, and Ned&#8217;s confidence was not as comforting as it
ordinarily was. She continued to look around as Ned dragged her towards the
van, and called Ernie&#8217;s name at increasing volume even after they had left the
bounds of the bridge&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>Ned, unlike Holly, still had a sense of rationality despite the straining
and confusing events of the day. Perhaps it was the fact that he was an
engineer, a professional, perhaps it was that he was male, but whatever the
reason, he was dealing with the situation as calmly and coolly as could be&nbsp;expected.</p>
<p>Upon their arrival at the van, he peered around, looking for signs of Ernie
and Ken both in and around the vehicle, but he found none. And Ken&#8217;s bike
wasn&#8217;t in the back. His initial reason for going to the van was to see if the
bike was still there, but upon inspection, he remembered that Ken had insisted
that he remove it when they had arrived. Holly was growing increasingly
agitated, allowing the worry of her maternal instinct get the best of&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>“Holly! Cal m down! I am going to go back and see if they went to the east
side of the bridge. I&#8217;ll be back in a few minutes. You wait here in case they
come back.&nbsp;<span class="caps">OK</span>?”</p>
<p>Holly nodded reluctantly in response. Ned made sure she was comfortable in
the passenger seat of the van, then turned and walked back towards the bridge.
He made his rounds, following roughly the same path that the quartet had made
earlier in the day, but no one had seen Ernie or Ken for quite some time. Some
people reported seeing them ride off on the bike about 45 minutes ago, so
Ned&#8217;s suspicion that they had left of their own accord was satisfactorily&nbsp;answered.</p>
<p>He returned to the van and continued to try and calm Holly, reassuring her
that both Ernie and Ken were not stupid, that they knew this area of town
well, that they had most likely ridden home on their own; they were&nbsp;fine.</p>
<p>Holly didn&#8217;t seem to believe him, but she reluctantly calmed down and agreed
that they should drive home. She could call St. Ives from home and make sure
Ernie was back. Ned was glad when he finally spun the wheel and maneuvered his
way back onto the road. He wanted to get home and have a stiff drink&nbsp;himself.</p>
<p>When he reached Holly&#8217;s small apartment, he debated whether or not to leave
her alone. She had calmed down considerably during the trip, and assured him
that she&#8217;d be fine. If she felt she needed anything, she&#8217;d call him and let
him know. She exited the van and waved half-heartedly as she opened the door
to her apartment building and&nbsp;entered.</p>
<p>Ned felt like he needed to calm his nerves, and driving had always been a
good way to do that, so he decided to take the long route home. His mind
wandered back to his homeland as he&nbsp;drove.</p>
<p>One of the core reasons that he and Lavina had emigrated to America was to
escape the violence that had plagued their country. Thankfully, neither Ned
nor Lavina had ever experienced the violence firsthand, but they had heard
terrible stories of roving “death gangs” that would travel around, raping,
beating and robbing anyone who got in their path. If they didn&#8217;t physically
kill you, they&#8217;d do enough psychological damage that it was essen tially the&nbsp;same.</p>
<p>Ned shook his head. America was not the land of promise that he had hoped
and dreamed it would be when he had contemplated the move from his European
home. America was no better than the rest of the world &#8211; it had the same
vices, the same violence and depravity, the same distaste for the less
fortunate. No, America was not the land he had been&nbsp;promised.</p>
<p>He approached the small house that his family called home and parked the van
on the street on the next block. His six children poured out of the front door
of the house, the older ones smiling in warm welcome, the youngest running up
to him and attaching themselves steadfastly to his legs. It had been an entire
day! How had they <em>ever</em> gotten along without&nbsp;him?</p>
<p>He walked, children in tow, towards their home. Lavina stood in the doorway,
a strange expression of disapproval on her round face. Ned entered the house
and hugged her close, ignoring the children&#8217;s burst of laughter as he swept
her back and kissed her fiercely on the lips. What a wonderful family they had
created &#8211;&nbsp;together!</p>
<p>But it soon became apparent that Lavina was not in the mood to revel in the
marvelous nature of their family. She pushed him away and said, “Someone is on
the phone for you. Young and she sounds&nbsp;upset.”</p>
<p>Ned sighed. Lavina had so many astonishing qualities, but she was jealous.
She thought that every young America n girl was on a personal mission to steal
her husband away, and she fought fiercely for her man, though Ned knew <em>that</em>
battle had been won long, long&nbsp;ago.</p>
<p>He walked into the small living room, sitting down heavily on the chair that
was his. The children did try, on many occasions, to claim it for themselves,
but it was well acknowledged among all members of the family that when Ned was
home, the chair was <em>his</em>, and no one&nbsp;else&#8217;s.</p>
<p>He was looking forward to a few minutes of relaxation on the chair, then it
would be time to do something really fun &#8211; work on the Jetta and get it up and
running again. He grinned just at the thought of getting under the hood and
immersing his hands in the greasy&nbsp;machinery.</p>
<p>He picked up the receiver and held it to his ear.&nbsp;“Hello?”</p>
<p>“Ned&#8230;” It was Holly, and she was crying. “I called St. Ives, and they said
he isn&#8217;t there! He hasn&#8217;t come home yet! Ned, something&#8217;s wrong, I know it. I
can&#8217;t explain it, but I <em>know</em> something isn&#8217;t&nbsp;right!”</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>, what do you want to do?” Ned was tired, but he knew he couldn&#8217;t just
let her sit in her apartment, by herself, and worry. No, he had an obligation,
as both a friend and a man, to help her &#8211; to make sure she felt like she was
helping the situation &#8211; if there even was a&nbsp;“situation.”</p>
<p>“Let&#8217;s go look for him. Maybe he&#8217;s hurt or something, you know, and if we
could&nbsp;just&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Holly, he&#8217;s probably <span class="caps">OK</span> &#8211; the chances of something happening are just&nbsp;so&#8230;”</p>
<p>“ <strong><em>Dammit</em></strong>, Ned! I <strong><em>know</em></strong> he&#8217;s not <span class="caps">OK</span>!” she screamed into the
phone, forcing Ned to move the handset away from his hear in a self-preserving&nbsp;reflex.</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>, <span class="caps">OK</span>, we&#8217;ll go looking for him. I&#8217;ll be there in 20&nbsp;minutes.”</p>
<p>“Thanks&nbsp;Ned.”</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>. I&#8217;ll see you in a few&nbsp;minutes.”</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>,&nbsp;bye.”</p>
<p>“Bye.”</p>
<p>He set the handset gently back on it&#8217;s rest, and laid his head back on the
chair, closing his eyes blissfully for a few seconds. Well, rest, relaxation,
and the Jetta would have to&nbsp;wait.</p>
<p>He stood up and called to Lavina. “I have to go out. Holly is worried about
one of the homeless guys she knows, and I&#8217;m going to go help her look for him.
I should be back in a couple of hours or&nbsp;so.”</p>
<p>Lavina met him in the hallway with yet another disapproving gaze. Out with a
beautiful young woman, no doubt. Well, <em>this</em> one wouldn&#8217;t steal her husband
away, oh no. She&#8217;d make sure of <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>Ned shook his head, knowing what she was thinking. “You needn&#8217;t worry,
darling. You&#8217;re the only woman for me.” He reached for her but she pulled
away. Oh well, someday she&#8217;d get over&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>, well I will see you and the children when I get back. Children, be
good, obey your mother, and I&#8217;ll be back soon.” A chorus of acknowledgments
came from various corners of the house, and he turned, threw his jack over his
shoulders, and stepped out into the&nbsp;darkness.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Chapter 20:&nbsp;Kidnapped </strong></p>
<p>Mike&#8217;s surrounding&#8217;s slowly faded into view as he came to. He had been
unconscious twice today! It was starting to wear on his mind physically, not
to mention his&nbsp;self-confidence.</p>
<p>He soon realized that he was tied, completely unable to move, to a chair in
the center of Angelo&#8217;s office. The pieces of the broken coffee table still lay
in front of the loveseat, though the girl was now gone. He struggled against
the ropes that tied him down, but they were tight around his wrists and
ankles, and the metal chair to which he was tied seemed too tough to break. It
wouldn&#8217;t matter much, anyway. There was no way he&#8217;d make it out of the
warehouse alive. He was more likely to rob a casino and run out of the front
door unopposed than to get out of the warehouse with his skin&nbsp;intact.</p>
<p>He was, to be honest, a little surprised to find himself still alive anyway.
It was very uncharacteristic of Angelo. But Angelo did have a bit of the James
Bond villain in him, and Mike assumed that a delightfully painful death or
maiming awaited&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>Angelo entered from the side door, smiling at Mike&#8217;s present consciousness.
He was closely followed by Marty, the man whose blow from behind had created a
lump on Mike&#8217;s head that still ached&nbsp;painfully.</p>
<p>“Well, Mike, it certainly is good to see you awake. It&#8217;s just not
gentlemanly to come and visit someone, then fall asleep while they&#8217;re trying
to be hospitable.” Mike ignored him as he paced around the chair to which Mike
was tied, his hands held behind his back in their customary formation, a smile
of supreme, gloating self-confidence written on his&nbsp;face.</p>
<p>“You may be wondering, Mike, why you are still alive after such an egregious
breach of my rules, of the trust that you and I have built over these past
months.” He paused, waiting for a response from Mike. There was&nbsp;none.</p>
<p>“And well you should. Ordinarily I would have killed you immediately –
wouldn&#8217;t have blinked, wouldn&#8217;t have given you a second thought.” He paused
again, ensuring Mike was&nbsp;listening.</p>
<p>“But I like you, Mike. I do. So I thought I&#8217;d give you a chance. You&#8217;ve
always been one to stick to my rules in the past, Mike, which gave me reason
to believe that something had happened to you. So, being the extremely
generous individual that I am &#8211; I <em>am</em> a humanitarian at heart, Mike, you
must believe me &#8211; I did a little sleuthing and discovered some very
interesting things about you&nbsp;Mike.”</p>
<p>Mike bristled. What the hell had Angelo dug up on him? And how had he done
it so quickly? Surely he hadn&#8217;t been out <em>that</em>&nbsp;long&#8230;</p>
<p>“Mike, I don&#8217;t know how to express to you my regret that Copeland saw fit to
fire you today.” That son of a <em>bitch</em>! “But Mike, you have to understand the
company&#8217;s position &#8211; you simply weren&#8217;t performing for them. You were a bad
horse to bet on, Mike. And you know something about betting on bad horses,
don&#8217;t you?” Angelo glanced at Mike, taking a perceptible pleasure in his
discomfort at the enraging&nbsp;comments.</p>
<p>“But it didn&#8217;t stop there, Mike, and I can honestly say that I fully
understand your actions in light of the new developments on the Turner home
front. From what I hear, Mrs. Marie Turner has told the police all about her
enraged husband who came home early and, in a fit of rage, brutally killed the
man she called her ‘one, true love.&#8217; Sad, really. You really need to learn to
control your anger, Mike. Didn&#8217;t I warn you about that last time we discussed
the races? Well, it doesn&#8217;t matter&#8230; it&#8217;s obvious you didn&#8217;t listen.” He
raised his hands above his head in mock&nbsp;consternation.</p>
<p>“Why do I even try? It&#8217;s so obvious that no one ever takes my advice to
heart!” Mike struggled violently against the ropes, causing the chair, and
himself, to fall to the floor, crushing his immobile arm uncomfortably beneath
him as he lay on his&nbsp;side.</p>
<p>Angelo knelt down, bringing his sweaty face within inches of Mike&#8217;s. His
breath reeked of acrid smoke and stale coffee; his eyes were still bloodshot
and spacey from the drugs. The toothpick he chewed in his mouth was crushed to
fine fibers from hours of nervous chewing. “The police are crawling the city
looking for you, Mike. It won&#8217;t be long before they find your wife&#8217;s <span class="caps">SUV</span>
outside&#8230; and then, I&#8217;ll have no choice but to hand you over. After all, I am
a law-abiding citizen &#8211; I don&#8217;t want to be party to a <em>murder</em>!”</p>
<p>He stood up, resuming his pacing. Mike remained on the floor, looking up at
Angelo, whose body seemed oddly out of proportion from this strange angle. “I
have a little surprise for you, Mike. A solution to <em>all</em> your problems. You
see, I have the resources necessary to keep you from the pigs&#8217; hands. I can
keep you safe. And all I ask in return is a little&#8230;” He held his index
finger and thumb slightly apart, illustrating just how little “a little” was.
“&#8230;Cooperation. Just a little cooperation. And if this goes well, I may even
be willing to forgive you that sizeable debt that you owe me. Now wouldn&#8217;t
that be&nbsp;something?”</p>
<p>Angelo&#8217;s mock-friendliness was beginning to annoy Mike, and the lack of
blood flow to his right arm was becoming extremely uncomfortable. He struggled
again against the ropes, but he had even less mobility than when he had made
his previous attempt, and his movements only confirmed the futility of his&nbsp;situation.</p>
<p>“Oh, Mike, forgive me, please! What a terrible host I am!” Angelo motioned
to Marty, who stood Mike&#8217;s chair back on it&#8217;s four legs. Mike winced as the
blood rushed back into his right arm, sending burning needles through its
entire&nbsp;length.</p>
<p>“You must forgive me, Mike. Sometimes I just get so caught up in the moment
that I forget my guests completely. It&#8217;s never intentional, I promise&nbsp;you.”</p>
<p>The phony act was really getting old. “You know what, Angelo, just cut the
bullshit and get to the&nbsp;point.”</p>
<p>Angelo frowned. He was having fun. But business was business. “Fine,” he
said. “Mike, you&#8217;re in deep shit. The cops are after you because of your
little ‘indiscretion&#8217; back at your house. So really, you don&#8217;t have much
choice. You&#8217;re going to do what I tell you, or I turn you over to the cops.
It&#8217;s that simple.&nbsp;Understand?”</p>
<p>Mike chose not to dignify the patronizing question with a response. Angelo
continued anyway. “You really should see the pictures of the man you killed,
Mike. It&#8217;s brilliant, the brutality of it, the unbridled primal passion of it
all. It&#8217;s damn near a work of art! And that&#8217;s what I need &#8211; an artist –
someone with a sense of the truly brutal, the truly primal. Someone like you,&nbsp;Mike.</p>
<p>“The organization I work with organizes a weekly ‘fight,&#8217; of sorts, and
you&#8217;re going to be the next prime attraction. You&#8217;re going to tap into that
vicious side of yourself that you love to channel so much and beat some other
guy to all hell. Or you&#8217;ll get beat to hell yourself. Either way, I&nbsp;win.”</p>
<p>He got close in to Mike&#8217;s face again. “Remember what I used to tell you,
Mike. The house <em>always</em> wins.” He smiled eerily. “Tell you what, you think
about it, and let us&nbsp;know.”</p>
<p>With that, a swift painless knock against his head brought on the blackness
once&nbsp;again.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ernie was walking alone along the nearly empty street, on his way back to
St. Ives. He hadn&#8217;t lasted long when James had started telling his story.
There were too many details, too many things to remember. Ernie liked his
stories short and sweet, and happy too. That was the worst part about James&#8217;
story &#8211; it had a sad&nbsp;ending.</p>
<p>He had grown bored and restless quickly, so he and Ken had left Ned and
Holly and had continued around the area asking people about Darryl. But Ken
had grown restless too, worried that his parents would be expecting him&nbsp;soon.</p>
<p>Ned and Holly were nowhere to be found, but fortunately, Ken had already
claimed his bike from the back of Ned&#8217;s van, anticipating needing to leave
before the others. 59th Street was within biking distance of Ken&#8217;s home, so
he and Ernie set off towards the nice suburban neighborhood, Ernie riding on
the rear pegs&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>The corner was empty as they passed by on Ken&#8217;s bike; the kids had all gone
in for the evening. The sun was sinking low &#8211; night was almost upon&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Ken had offered to let Ernie stay in the garage again, so that Ernie
wouldn&#8217;t need to make the dangerous journey back to St. Ives, but Ernie had
grown hungry again, and he longed for some of Rho nda&#8217;s soup and the warmth of
his soft, familiar bed. So despite Ken&#8217;s protests and his own judgment, he had
set off alone back towards St.&nbsp;Ives.</p>
<p>The light had steadily decreased as he had progressed on his trip, until the
sun had dropped completely beyond the curvature of the earth, leaving nothing
but the occasionally visible stars and moon and the flickering streetlamps to
light the&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>Ernie wasn&#8217;t particularly nervous. He had made the trip plenty of times
before, and even in the darkness, but the stories that he and Ken had been
hearing throughout the day of mysterious abductions caused him to be more wary
than&nbsp;normal.</p>
<p>There was nothing to give him concern, though. The street was quiet, except
for the occasional rustle of a paper cup or newspaper blowing along the
asphalt in the wind. Every so often, a car would round a corner and pass
slowly by him, but for the most part, he had the entire quiet street to&nbsp;himself.</p>
<p>And so he walked on, not paying much attention to the car that passed by
him, moving more slowly than the others, and not noticing that it was the same
car that had passed him three ties now. It came to a stop at the curb a half
block in front of Ernie, and the back door opened. A nice looking man stepped
out, dressed in a suit and tie, wearing a fedora on his head, and smiling
broadly at Ernie as he&nbsp;approached.</p>
<p>“Ernie!” he exclaimed as he approached, arms wide in greeting. “I thought it
was you! I&#8217;m glad I stopped. No music&nbsp;today?”</p>
<p>Ernie didn&#8217;t recognize the man. How did he know his name? He stiffened as
the man encompassed his body with his&nbsp;arms.</p>
<p>“I haven&#8217;t seen you in awhile! Hey, are you heading to St. Ives? How about a
ride? It&#8217;s getting kind of chilly out here&#8230; I&#8217;m sure Rho nda would prefer it
if you came in and got yourself something to eat. How about it?” He motioned
to the still open back door of the car a few meters in front of&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Ernie nodded. This man may know him, but Ernie didn&#8217;t recognize his face,
and Rho nda had warned him nev er to get into strange cars with people he
didn&#8217;t know. In fact, Rho nda had been clear that he shouldn&#8217;t even speak with
those he didn&#8217;t know, but he wasn&#8217;t really brea king that particular rule; the
other man was doing all the&nbsp;talking.</p>
<p>Ernie stepped around the man and continued on his way, but the man followed
him and kept talking. “Oh, come on, Ernie,” he said, wrapping one arm around
him as if they were pals. “I really have something I want to talk to you
about! I know you have a lot of problems&#8230; you know, money problems, and
problems remembering things, and stuff&#8230; I just want to help you out. Tell
you what, get in the back of the car, and I&#8217;ll feel you in on my plan&#8230; I can
solve all of your problems, I can get you out, Ernie, honest, but you need to
get in the&nbsp;car.”</p>
<p><em>If a man ever comes to you, sayin&#8217; he&#8217;s got da answer, dat he can get you
out, you just gots to do one thing, don&#8217;t listen to &#8216;im.</em> Darryl&#8217;s warning
came flooding back to him, and he felt a sudden chill of fear. He wrenched his
body away from the man&#8217;s arm and began to run down the street, but the man&#8217;s
car was already pulling up ahead of&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>Two men stepped out and ran towards him. He attempted to turn and cross the
street, but they were surprisingly quick, and headed him off in the middle of
the street. They wrapped their strong arms around his body, and forced a
strange-smelling rag in his face. He struggled briefly, and felt his Walkman
slide from it&#8217;s customary position on his waistband and clatter on the floor.
The men dragged him towards the car, and pushed him roughly into the trunk as
he passed&nbsp;out.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Chapter 19:&nbsp;Story </strong></p>
<p>Holly and Ned sat down along the slope beside the drain pipe, looking
intently at the grizzled man who lounged on the pipe in front of them. He wore
a small, faded green kufi on his head, hiding his graying hair underneath it.
His face was crinkled with age, and his kind eyes glowed warmly out of the dim
surroundings. He held his hands in his lap, moving them expressively as he
spoke softly. His dark, rich voice echoed below the bridge as he told his&nbsp;tale.</p>
<p>“Well, like I was sayin&#8217;, me and Darryl was good friends. We tried to stick
together, you know, have each other&#8217;s back. ‘Course it wasn&#8217;t always that way.
Fact is, when we first met, we didn&#8217;t much care for each other at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>“You see, we first met when I tried to work his part of State Ave. one day.
I hadn&#8217;t been doing too well on my old strip, so I thought I&#8217;d move up further
north and see if I could do any&nbsp;better.</p>
<p>“The week before, I&#8217;d managed to come across some tools at a construction
site and had nabbed a squeegee there, so not only was I imposin&#8217; on Darryl&#8217;s
section of the street, I was also doing the exact gig he was. Not to mention,
I was just learnin&#8217; the trade, you know, and I hadn&#8217;t really had a chance to
hone my technique. So I wasn&#8217;t doin&#8217; the best job of cleain&#8217; the windows,
‘specially compared to&nbsp;Darryl.</p>
<p>“It was all right the first few days, since we didn&#8217;t run into each other. A
couple of guys had told me that Darryl normally squeegeed that section of the
street, but to be honest, I didn&#8217;t care. I was just trying to eke by, know
what I&nbsp;mean?</p>
<p>“But eventually, Darryl and I ran into each other. He had been hearin&#8217; stuff
about another guy down on his street ruinin&#8217; his reputation and all, so when
he finally saw me, he wasn&#8217;t to pleased. But if you know Darryl, he wadn&#8217;t one
to get real angry and up in your face about somethin&#8217;. So he stopped me later
that afternoon after most people had cleared the street ad I was headin&#8217; home,
and he simply asked me to move either further north or further&nbsp;south.</p>
<p>“He explained that he&#8217;d been workin&#8217; that partickler section of the street
for some time, and that he had reputation that he&#8217;d built, and it just
wouldn&#8217;t work to have two guys tryin&#8217; to squeegee the same section. He
explained that it made more sense for us to split up ‘cause we&#8217;d be able to
have more&nbsp;customers.</p>
<p>“Wal, what he said made sense, but it wasn&#8217;t what I wanted to hear. And him
bein&#8217; so friendly about everything, I didn&#8217;t take him seriously. So I told him
he could shove it and I just kept on goin&#8217;, doin&#8217; what I always&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>“Next day, Darryl came up and said basically the same thing, askin&#8217; me to
move on north or south again. And again, I told him the same thing. But he was
a persistent bastard, and every day he came up to me, polite as the last time,
and explained the situation&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>“Eventually, it got to the point where I was considerin&#8217; movin&#8217; on just so I
wouldn&#8217;t have to listen to his lecture every day. I started tryin&#8217; to avoid
him during the day, but he usually found&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>“One day, I had had it partickly rough, and there he was, comin&#8217; on to ask
be to move on, and I just lost it. I let him have it. We got into a bit of a
scuffle, and Darryl, bein&#8217; as mild-mannered and small as he was, didn&#8217;t put up
much of a fight. Oh, don&#8217;t get me wrong, I didn&#8217;t hurt him real bad or
nothin&#8217;, but I did pound on him a&nbsp;bit.</p>
<p>“It made me feel a lot better, and I thought that he&#8217;d finally get the
picture that I wasn&#8217;t plannin&#8217; on goin&#8217; anywhere, but the next day, he found
me again and started talkin&#8217; to&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>“This time, though, he&#8217;d changed his tactics. He said that if I wasn&#8217;t
movin&#8217; on, the least I could do was stop ruinin&#8217; his reputation. So he offered
to teach me how to do a better job with the squeegee. I could hardly believe
my ears. I mean, I&#8217;d just hit him up the day before &#8211; he still had a bruise on
his face from where I&#8217;d let him have&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>“But as usual, it was a genuine offer, so I spent that day workin&#8217; with him,
learnin&#8217; his technique and listenin&#8217; to him ramble on about his experiences
and whatnot. Man, he liked to talk.” He paused, smiling and shaking his&nbsp;head.</p>
<p>“I mean, Darryl&#8217;d talk and talk and talk &#8211; didn&#8217;t matter if no one was
listenin&#8217;. He just liked to talk. But anyway, that night he invited me back
here, to this bridge, with him, and we spent the rest of the night talkin&#8217;
‘bout everything under the&nbsp;sun.</p>
<p>“And that was really all it took. We started workin&#8217; together every day, and
he taught me a lot. And he and I just became real good friends. I don&#8217;t really
know why. By all accounts, we really shoulda still hated each other. We were
very different people, but somehow we ended up makin&#8217; it&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>“Eventually he and I agreed to stop workin&#8217; together. It really made the
most sense, since we could cover twice as much area in the same amount of
time. He finally got his way, I guess &#8211; I moved on up a lit further north and
he stayed working his area, but we would get together here at the end of the
day, and share whatever we had. Sometimes he had a good day, sometimes I did,
most times neither of us did, but we shared everything and we ended up all
right I&nbsp;guess.</p>
<p>“As time went on, me and him didn&#8217;t talk as much as we had, and he started
spending more time at the shelter, I guess. I never much cared for places like
that, though he told me St. Ives was diff&#8217;rent. Anyway, when we started
hearin&#8217; all the stories ‘bout people disappearin&#8217;, we decided we&#8217;d better
start stickin&#8217; together again. It just made sense. So we started workin&#8217;
together again, and we did all&nbsp;right.</p>
<p>“But one night, Darryl decided he wanted to go to the shelter for a meal,
and when I told him I really didn&#8217;t want to go, he just left without me. I
didn&#8217;t seem him until really late the next day. I figgered he&#8217;d just ended up
stayin&#8217; the night there or somethin&#8217;, but when he came back he was all beat
up. He&#8217;d stopped by St. Ives ad I guess got cleaned up, but he looked
terrible. He was limpin&#8217;, cuts and bruises all over his body &#8211; he was a&nbsp;wreck.</p>
<p>“He wasn&#8217;t talkin&#8217; much either, and I knew better than to press him to tell
me what had happened. So we just kept on doin&#8217; what we always did for the next
few days. I figgered he&#8217;d tell me when he was ready. And finally, about a week
after it had happened, he&nbsp;did.”</p>
<p>James paused and leaned forward, lowering his voice substantially. “Now,
there were two cops snoopin&#8217; around here earlier today, askin&#8217; about him and
showin&#8217; pictures and whatnot, but I didn&#8217;t tell ‘em anything.” Holly and Ned
glanced at each other as James frowned. So Ames and Cobb <em>had</em> been&nbsp;by.</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t like cops &#8211; don&#8217;t trust ‘em. Anyway, you have to understand, I&#8217;m
takin&#8217; a big risk tellin&#8217; you this, just like Darryl took a risk by tellin&#8217;
me, but people need to know. Maybe then somethin&#8217; can be&nbsp;done.”</p>
<p>He paused again, drawing Ned and Holly in closer before continuing at an
even lower volume. “Darryl told me, that as he was walkin&#8217; to St. Ives, that a
man had pulled over on the street &#8211; he couldn&#8217;t remember exactly where &#8211; and
started talkin&#8217; to him. He had said he recognized Darryl from a time when he&#8217;d
cleaned the windshield of his car, and he just wanted to compliment him on the&nbsp;job.</p>
<p>“He gave Darryl a twenty dollar bill, and then asked him if he wanted to
make a lot more. He told Darryl that it was a really simple thing he needed
done, and that if Darryl was willing there could be a lot of money in&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>“Darryl wasn&#8217;t one to believe in these get-rich-quick schemes, but he told
me that the man seemed so sincere &#8211; so honest and friendly. So Darryl accepted
the offer and had accepted a ride in the man&#8217;s car. He didn&#8217;t know where they
had gone. He said they had driven for quite&nbsp;awhile.</p>
<p>“They arrived at some warehouse or somethin&#8217;, and the man had led Darryl
into this huge empty room. Then, while Darryl waited, a whole bunch of men
started coming in and standing around the inner walls of the room. Darryl said
at least 30 to 40 men had come in, and they just stood around, not talkin&#8217; to
him or anything, just stayin&#8217; quiet with these serious expressions on their
faces, like they were anticipatin&#8217; somethin&#8217; exciting. Most of ‘em were
wearin&#8217; suits or sports jackets, Darryl had said, and they all seemed to be
businessmen or somethin&#8217; judgin&#8217; from what they were&nbsp;wearin&#8217;.</p>
<p>“Then the man who had picked Daryl up walked in and started talkin&#8217;. ‘Well
gentlemen, tonight we have a man named Darryl. He works down on State Ave. ,
where many of you work, and squeegees your windows for loose change&#8230; I think
a lot of you are familiar with him.&#8217; A lot of the men standing around let out
a whoop, and the man smiled. ‘Well, I think you all know how this works, so
who&#8217;s first tonight?&#8217; A bunch of men raised their hands, and the man pointed
to one in the back of the room. ‘<span class="caps">OK</span>, looks like you&#8217;re our lucky guy tonight.
Make us proud.&#8217; The man who&#8217;d picked Darryl up stepped out with the other men,
and the one he&#8217;d pointed out stepped into the center of the circle with
Darryl. Darryl didn&#8217;t know what was&nbsp;happenin&#8217;.</p>
<p>“The man took his shirt off and ran towards Darryl, and hit him square in
the face, knocking him to the ground. He waited for Darryl to get back up,
then hit him again. Darryl tried to get up and run away, or out of the room,
but the men in the circle would grab him and throw him back&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>“I asked ‘im if he tried to fight back, and he said he did, but there were
too many of ‘em. As soon as he got a good shot in, somebody else would step
into the circle and beat him even harder. By the end of the night, he said he
was just layin&#8217; on the floor, blood leakin&#8217; out of him, prayin&#8217; that&#8217;d all be
over soon. He passed out while they were still beatin&#8217; on&nbsp;him.”</p>
<p>Holly felt like she was going to be sick. She had experienced her share of
violence, but this beating that James spoke of sounded almost sports-like. Who
were all these men? Did they really get off on beating a defenseless homeless
man nearly to&nbsp;death?</p>
<p>James noticed his audience&#8217;s discomfort and broke off his more detailed
description that Darryl had given him. His voice was still low and he looked
around nervously, searching for anyone that might be listening in
surreptitiously. Satisfied that all was clear, he&nbsp;continued.</p>
<p>“Anyway, Darryl came to after the man who&#8217;d picked him up splashed some
water on his face. They threw him back into the car and drove him back to the
street where they&#8217;d picked him up. Before they dropped him off, the man said,
‘Darryl, I hope you understand that if you tell anyone about this, and I mean
anyone,&#8217; &#8211; he was very clear on this point &#8211; ‘I&#8217;m gonna hunt you down and kill
not only <em>you</em>, but <em>every single person that you told</em>.&#8217; Darryl believed
him. He said there was somethin&#8217; in his eyes that told him he was&nbsp;serious.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Darryl wouldn&#8217;t tell nobody &#8211; and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been careful
m&#8217;self. But there comes a time when this kinda things got to be exposed, and
maybe y&#8217;all can do&nbsp;it.”</p>
<p>James sat back on the pipe and sighed heavily. He was pleased to finally
tell someone Darryl&#8217;s story, but worried too &#8211; now these fine people, friends
of Darryl&#8217;s, also had the burden of Darryl&#8217;s experience? There was little
doubt in James&#8217; mind that the man responsible for Darryl&#8217;s abduction and
beating was also responsible for his death. Would he also now harm these
people, and James&nbsp;himself?</p>
<p>Holly and Ned looked at each other. They also understood the magnitude of
the situation. It seemed their quest for answers had yielded some, but also
created more&nbsp;questions.</p>
