writing a 50,000-word fictional novel in the 30 days of November. The journey
will be difficult, but with your prayers I will be victorious. I am
registered at the <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.com">NaNoWriMo website</a> as dragonfly2004. Feel free to look
me up. I will be posting my manuscript in its entirety <a href="/tag/nanowrimo">on this site</a> as I
write it. Hopefully I will also have time to post some stats on how I am
doing, but no guarantees. I&#8217;d love for people to read what I write and offer
encouragement during the month, but I&#8217;d prefer if there were no comments
regarding the characters, plot, themes, or anything of the sort, because I
want to be able to focus on my vision for the month and not second-guess my
decisions while I am trying to write. Wish me&nbsp;luck.</p>

                                    <p><span class="caps">OK</span>, this is ridiculous. The Department of Homeland Security can&#8217;t find
anything better to do, apparently, than harass small business owners. Check
out this <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=816&amp;e=1&amp;u=/ap/20041028/ap_on_fe_st/toy_store_homeland_security">Yahoo News story</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="caps">ST</span>. <span class="caps">HELENS</span>, Ore. - So far as she knows, Pufferbelly Toys owner Stephanie Cox
hasn&#8217;t been passing any state secrets to sinister foreign governments, or
violating obscure clauses in the Patriot&nbsp;Act.</p>
<p>So she was taken aback by a mysterious phone call from the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Department of
Homeland Security to her small store in this quiet Columbia River town just
north of&nbsp;Portland.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I was shaking in my shoes,&#8221; Cox said of the September phone call. &#8220;My first
thought was the government can shut your business down on a whim, in my
opinion. If I&#8217;m closed even for a day that would cause undue&nbsp;stress.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the two agents arrived at the store, the lead agent asked Cox whether she
carried a toy called the Magic Cube, which he said was an illegal copy of the
Rubik&#8217;s Cube, one of the most popular toys of all&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>He told her to remove the Magic Cube from her shelves, and he watched to make
sure she&nbsp;complied.</p>
<p>After the agents left, Cox called the manufacturer of the Magic Cube, the
Toysmith Group, which is based in Auburn, Wash. A representative told her that
Rubik&#8217;s Cube patent had expired, and the Magic Cube did not infringe on the
rival toy&#8217;s&nbsp;trademark.</p>
<p>Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for <strong>Immigration and Customs Enforcement</strong>, said
agents went to Pufferbelly based on a trademark infringement complaint filed
in the agency&#8217;s intellectual property rights center in Washington,&nbsp;<span class="caps">D.C.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>One of the things that our agency&#8217;s responsible for doing is protecting the integrity of the economy and our nation&#8217;s financial systems and obviously trademark infringement does have significant economic implications,&#8221;</strong> she said.
Six weeks after her brush with Homeland Security, Cox told The Oregonian she
is still bewildered by the&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Aren&#8217;t there any terrorists out there?&#8221; she&nbsp;said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have several problems with this whole event. First of all, why is the
&#8220;protection&#8221; of our nation&#8217;s economy the responsibility of the government at
all, least of all the <span class="caps">DHS</span>? We&#8217;re supposed to be [relatively] free market,
right? Second, why is someone from the <strong>Immigration and Customs Enforcement</strong>
office doing the commenting? This makes even less sense! Third, it&#8217;s a Rubik&#8217;s
Cube for crying out loud! And the patent&#8217;s expired! Finally, wasn&#8217;t the <span class="caps">DHS</span>
created to safeguard our country from terrorists? Even if terrorists <strong>were</strong>
infringing on trademarks (which I seriously doubt they are), I&#8217;d still rather
the <span class="caps">DHS</span> leave them alone if they can&#8217;t actually tell a terrorist from a small
business&nbsp;owner.</p>
<p>On the other hand, had this happened to me I probably would have asked for
some paperwork or something proving they had authority to do this, but then,
we live in a culture of fear here in the <span class="caps">US</span>, so I can&#8217;t say I blame Ms. Cox
for simply complying. She hadn&#8217;t done anything wrong, after all. What did she
have to fear? (The answer is <em>everything</em>. Government sucks. And yes, I am
<a href="/2004/09/tolls-and-cameras/">paranoid</a>.)</p>

                                    <p>I finally got fed up with <span class="caps">XP</span> on my laptop. I don&#8217;t use it much for games
anymore, so I decided that it was time to try Linux again. I had previously
loaded Suse 9.1 on it over the summer, but I could never get my Linksys <span class="caps">WPC54G</span>
<span class="caps">PCMCIA</span> wireless card working, no matter what I tried, so I gave up. I didn&#8217;t
want to shell out cash for a new card, and a laptop without wireless is a
pitiful thing. Also, I used to like <span class="caps">KDE</span>, but it looked really bad on my
laptop, and I simply didn&#8217;t feel like going through all the hassle of trying
to get Gnome up on a <span class="caps">KDE</span>-centric distro. Finally at that point I was still
using Outlook (gasp!), and I didn&#8217;t relish trying to convert everything into
Evolution <em>again</em>. So I went back to <span class="caps">XP</span> for&nbsp;awhile.</p>
<p>Then I made the switch to GMail, and based on some high praise that
<a href="http://www.ubuntu-linux.org">Ubuntu</a> was getting from Patrick and others, I thought I might as well
give it a try. I needed to reformat my laptop anyway, and I figured if I
didn&#8217;t like it or it didn&#8217;t work, I could always just put <span class="caps">XP</span> back on&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>Well, I am proud to say that Ubuntu up and running on my laptop. I was able to
<em>very</em> easily set up my wireless card using <a href="http://ndiswrapper.sf.net">NDiswrapper</a>, and there was
even a helpful guide linked to on the Ubuntu website. It doesn&#8217;t allow me to
monitor link quality and everything, but at least it&nbsp;works.</p>
<p>I have never used a Debian-based distro before, but I really like it so far.
The package management has been great, and using alien I&#8217;ve been able to load
up some <span class="caps">RPM</span>&#8217;s as Deb packages as well. I&#8217;ve got <a href="http://beatniksoftware.com/tomboy/">Tomboy</a> running, which is
cool (I&#8217;m using it for notes about my upcoming novel), and I am installing
<a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/beagle/">Beagle</a> as we speak. I like the overall polish of Gnome, but the &#8220;spatial
browsing&#8221; is driving me nuts. I want an address bar! I suppose I&#8217;ll get used
to it - it&#8217;s my only major complaint right now. Well, that and the fact that
there&#8217;s no <span class="caps">IE</span> for Linux (haha). I need it for work - Firefox doesn&#8217;t render
the application we use for ticket management correctly. I have to use <span class="caps">RDP</span> and
log into my server to enter tickets. And I&#8217;m still having problems getting
Samba and Web Folders shared between my Windows boxes and Ubuntu. But
hopefully <a href="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?ifolder">iFolder</a> will help with&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>Anyway, overall I am very pleased with my new setup so far, and have not yet
found any truly compelling reasons to switch back to <span class="caps">XP</span>. Here&#8217;s hoping I
don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m certainly learning a lot more with&nbsp;Linux.</p>

                                    <p>Microsoft is coming to campus on Thursday and Friday of this week, and I
managed to get an interview. One of the guys who&#8217;s coming is an alumnus from
<span class="caps">IIT</span>, and he used to be in <a href="http://www.hawktour.net/">my <span class="caps">IPRO</span></a> (back before it became <strong><em>my</em></strong> <span class="caps">IPRO</span>),
and he sent me an email asking if I knew of anyone from the <span class="caps">IPRO</span> that I would
recommend he interview. I gave him the only name I could in good conscience,
and suggested he interview me as well. So he asked for my resume, and I got an
email this afternoon requesting my preference for an interview time. I&#8217;m not
sure if any of it&#8217;s going to pan out, but it&#8217;s a good opportunity nonetheless.
I&#8217;m also not too sure how I feel about working for <span class="caps">MS</span>, but I&#8217;ll cross that
bridge if/when I come to it. Wish me&nbsp;luck!</p>

<p>Well, I made it past the first two hurdles. The on-campus interview went well,
and I must have impressed Ondrej enough that he pushed my resume on through to
an official recruiter. The recruiter emailed me today about setting up a phone
interview Wednesday next week. The way I understand it is that if the phone
interview goes well, then I&#8217;ll be heading out to Redmond for an on-site
interview. Then, if they&#8217;re <em>really</em> interested, I&#8217;ll get an&nbsp;offer.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am excited, but would appreciate your thoughts and prayers. This is
a big deal for me. I&#8217;m keeping my fingers&nbsp;crossed.</p>

<p>Well, I finally heard back from them today, and they are moving me through to
the next stage of the interview. I still don&#8217;t know the logistics yet, and it
kind of throws a wrench in the works with my current plans for next semester,
but I&#8217;m sure I can work something out if I get an offer.&nbsp;:-)</p>

<p>Looks like I am flying out to Seattle on February 7th, interviewing on the
8th, then flying back on the 9th. I am excited, but a little nervous as well.
Hopefully I&#8217;ll impress&nbsp;them.</p>

                                    <p>I have, after much thought, decided to disable anonymous commenting on this
site. For one thing, there are actually blog spammers who hit me with a few
long non-sensical spam comments every once in awhile. But I could deal with
that &#8211; and if I had the time, I could even upgrade <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/">Geeklog</a> so it would
block most of the spam. But that wasn&#8217;t the real problem &#8211; the real problem is
that people post comments and I have absolutely no idea who they are. Most of
my friends are nice &#8211; Patrick and Kim usually sign their comment posts, which
is nice. There are, however, a few people who never do, and I am forced to go
looking through my access logs to figure out what <span class="caps">IP</span> accessed the site at the
approximate time the comment was posted, then lookup the <span class="caps">IP</span> and see if I can
think of anyone I might know that uses <span class="caps">ISP</span>. While I certainly do enjoy being
<a href="/2002/04/april-16-2002/">Sherlock Holmes</a> on occasion, this is just too much. So Pat, Kim, Ricardo,
and anyone else who indulges me by reading this, please just set yourself up an
account and post your comments &#8211; I really do like it when you post comments.
It makes me feel all warm and bubbly&nbsp;inside.</p>
