                                    <p>Wow, it&#8217;s been awhile. Almost a year since my last post. It truly is hard to
believe. It&#8217;s been a busy year so far, but I&#8217;ve finally got some time to start
posting again. I&#8217;ve got some interesting SharePoint posts coming down the
pipe, plus a new site design I&#8217;m working on. It&#8217;s still in its early stages,
but hopefully it&#8217;ll shape up pretty soon so I can get a sample&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>One thing you&#8217;ll notice if you&#8217;ve been here before is that I&#8217;ve managed to
move the site into the 21st century by adding comments. I toyed with a few
different comment management add-ins and ended up going with <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>. It
seems like it&#8217;ll suit my needs for now, and it was pretty straightforward to
get integrated. Just added some script and markup to my master page and post
page layout in SharePoint Designer. I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about the comments
being stored separately from the site content, but it&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve got for now.
It will make migration difficult if page <span class="caps">URL</span>&#8217;s change, which they almost
certainly are when I change the architecture of the site in the next redesign.
C&#8217;est la vie, I&#8217;ll cross that bridge when I get to it. Anyway, please go ahead
and engage with me through the comments if you see something interesting on
the&nbsp;site.</p>
<p>I should also note, for completeness, that SharePoint includes a blog template
that supports comments. I, however, <a href="/2006/11/building-tylerbutlercom-on-moss/">rolled my own site</a> and didn&#8217;t use the
blog template or features. There were lots of reasons for this that I won&#8217;t go
into right now, but there are certainly some features that SharePoint blogs
have that I also want, like comments and MetaWeblog support (which I added
myself). For now, I&#8217;m stuck with what I&#8217;ve got. But like I said, there are
some exciting new things coming with my site&nbsp;redesign.</p>

                                    <p>Once upon a time, there was a very wealthy man. The man had so much money that
he bought anything and everything he could buy, and still had more money than
he could count. As he grew older and wiser, he realized he was very unhappy.
So he gathered all of his friends and confidants and asked them for their&nbsp;advice.</p>
<p>During the course of the conversation, a friend mentioned that there was a
University close by filled with struggling students. The man decided he would
give money to any student that wanted&nbsp;some.</p>
<p>The next day, the man walked to the main section of the University campus and
arranged to rent out a small room in the center of the main campus student
building, where all the students could come to get their money from him. He
then sat down on a chair in the small room and&nbsp;waited.</p>
<p>And&nbsp;waited.</p>
<p>And&nbsp;waited.</p>
<p>And&nbsp;waited.</p>
<p>For months, he would visit the campus every day and wait in the small room for
students to come and claim their money. But no one ever came. Eventually, he
became a fixture on campus. Students would smile and wave at him as they
passed by the small room; some would say hello and ask how he was. But no one
ever asked for&nbsp;money.</p>
<p>One day, while he sat in the small room, the man was approached by a student
who had always been very friendly to the man. She stopped by every day and
said hello and told him about her classes. She was always bright and cheerful.
On this day, however, her eyes were puffy and red, and she walked as though
the weight of the world was on her&nbsp;shoulders.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Sir, I just wanted to come by and say&nbsp;goodbye…&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Oh? Why&#8217;s&nbsp;that?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Well, my mom&#8217;s been really sick &#8211; and she&#8217;s better now, but my family has a
ton of hospital bills and I just can&#8217;t afford to stay here at school any&nbsp;longer.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Why didn&#8217;t you say something before? I&#8217;ve been sitting here every day for
months just waiting for someone to ask me for money, and no one ever has! Why
didn&#8217;t you ask me before?&#8221; the man&nbsp;asked.</p>
<p>The girl looked up, her eyes glimmering with&nbsp;hope.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Why didn&#8217;t <strong><em>you</em></strong> say something? How was I to know you were giving money
away unless you said something? I would never have guess that&#8217;s why you sit
here every day. But… can I have some&nbsp;money?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man smiled and pulled his checkbook from his pocket. &#8220;How much do you&nbsp;need?&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day, when the man arrived at the University, there was line of needy
students outside the small room. The line reached out the doors of the
building and wrapped all around&nbsp;campus.</p>
<p>The man asked every student why they had never come to him before, even though
they needed money. &#8220;Because you didn&#8217;t tell me that&#8217;s why you were here,&#8221; they&nbsp;said.</p>

                                    <p>Everyone repeat after me&#8230; <strong>Correlation does not <em>imply</em> causation!</strong> Just
because two things can be proven to correlate does not guarantee a cause and
effect relationship. Here&#8217;s a funny example from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation">Wikipedia article</a> on
the topic (courtesy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons:">The Simpsons</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Not a bear in sight. The &#8220;Bear Patrol&#8221; is working like a&nbsp;charm!</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: That&#8217;s specious reasoning,&nbsp;Dad.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: [<em>uncomprehendingly</em>] Thanks,&nbsp;honey.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: By your logic, I could claim that this rock keeps tigers&nbsp;away.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Hmm. How does it&nbsp;work?</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: It doesn&#8217;t work. (<em>pause</em>) It&#8217;s just a stupid&nbsp;rock!</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>:&nbsp;Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: But I don&#8217;t see any tigers around, do&nbsp;you?</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: (<em>pause</em>) Lisa, I want to buy your&nbsp;rock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please please please stop assuming that determining a cause and effect
relationship is as straightforward as observing a correlation. It&#8217;s&nbsp;not.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I know the <code>!=</code> operator is not equivalent to &#8220;does not imply.&#8221; But I am 
too lazy right now to see if there&#8217;s even a Unicode character for the right&nbsp;symbol.</p>

                                    <p>Should you ever find yourself watching a street performer&#8217;s act, and you end
up volunteering, either willingly or unwillingly, to be a part of said act,
here&#8217;s a piece of advice: don&#8217;t run away when the performer&#8217;s not looking. If
you do, you might find out later that you&#8217;re missing something that might be
important to you. This is what happened to Emily, a rather skittish young
German woman who happens to be visiting Brisbane this week, and is now missing
her&nbsp;watch.</p>
<p>While I was walking back to the Kookaburra this afternoon, I passed through
the Queen Street Mall and stopped to view a street magician. Shortly after I
started watching, he approached a girl in the audience to act as his second
&#8220;assistant.&#8221; The girl didn&#8217;t look particularly happy to have been chosen, but
rather than protest she joined the performer in front of the audience. Soon
she was introduced s Emily from Germany, to much enthusiastic adulation from
the&nbsp;crowd.</p>
<p>The performer continued on with his act, which primarily involved his first
assistant, another young woman named Charlie. While he turned to face Charlie
and continued on, Emily turned and left, running swiftly into the swelling
crowd at the mall. It took a few seconds for both the audience and the
performer to figure out what was happening. The crowd started laughing at her
departure, but the performer yelled after her, &#8220;Wait! You&#8217;re missing
something!&#8221; With that, he pulled a hand watch from his pocket and waved it
above his head. Alas, Emily ran on, and was soon lost in the crowd. The
performer looked a bit baffled, jokingly offered the watch to anyone who would
buy it, then continued on with his act (with a new second&nbsp;assistant).</p>
<p>My first thought was that Emily was in on it, but after the act a few people
approached the performer and asked if it was scripted. He explained that it
wasn&#8217;t. He had removed her watch surreptitiously as part of his act and was
planning to reveal it to her later on. His intention was by no means to steal
her watch, but when she ran off so unexpectedly he didn&#8217;t know what to&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>So people, if you wind up in a street performer&#8217;s act, please just be good-
natured about it and participate. It&#8217;s really not that&nbsp;hard.</p>

                                    <p>Seriously, the next time you&#8217;re in Portland, go to <a href="http://www.sanbornsbreakfast.com/">Sanborn&#8217;s</a> and get some breakfast. Freaking <strong><em>amazing</em></strong>
food. Elizabeth and I went there last weekend during our trip down there.
Despite the fact that we got lost (I blame our crummy <span class="caps">GPS</span> technology - or
maybe it was the navigator?), once we found it it lived up to the hype.
Definitely get the biscuits - I am drooling right now just thinking about
them… The pancakes and omelet&#8217;s were also very very good. It was busy, but
service was decent. We also went to <a href="http://www.lucystable.com/">Lucy&#8217;s Table</a> for dinner,
which I can also highly recommend. Excellent food and service, though it was a
bit pricey. I&#8217;d liken it to Café Juanita in Kirkland in terms of quality and
atmosphere. Unfortunately, not all of our dining experiences in the City of
Roses were good. Despite good reviews on CitySearch, the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=2&amp;url=http://portland.citysearch.com/profile/8470102/portland_or/j_m_cafe.html&amp;ei=F-2_Rt7KOJTshQPp7PHtCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9s9ncpZ9VZT_leK3fVMu9YQe7kA&amp;sig2=gBiGHh4kr9purLuxpfy2ng">J&amp;M Café</a> left a lot to be desired. Not outright <strong><em>bad</em></strong>, but definitely nothing to write home about. Meh. And also note that the only <a href="http://www.sonicdrivein.com/">Sonic</a> within 200 miles of Seattle is in a Portland suburb. Mmmmmm, <strong><em>so</em></strong> worth the&nbsp;drive.</p>
