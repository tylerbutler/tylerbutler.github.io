                                    <p>At work, we have a mindless task that has to be done manually every hour.
Basically, we have to log into this website and click around a bit to make
sure that the site is still up and running. It&#8217;s pretty ridiculous, I know,
but it has to be done nonetheless. No one in the office ever remembers to do
it, so I decided it might be nice to have an alarm of sorts. So I remembered
some of my old Micrososft Agent tinkering back in High School, and looked
around for some examples of using the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/speech/download/sdk51/">Windows speech <span class="caps">API</span></a> in C#. It didn&#8217;t
take me long to figure it out, and the code for my simple text-to-speech
program is deceptively simple. Instead of providing the code as a download,
I&#8217;m just posting it here since it is so&nbsp;short.</p>

<p>Basically all you need is the code above and the Interop.SpeechLib.dll file,
which provides access to the speech utilities. For completeness (and since I
had some trouble finding the <span class="caps">DLL</span>), I put a copy of the file up on here.
This program basically just echoes back whatever string you pass in at the
command line, so to get the scheduling working, I just used Windows Task
Scheduler. I scheduled a task to run every hour ever day between 8am and 10pm
(check the advanced settings of the Task Scheduler), then pointed the task to
the compiled program, passing it the string I want it to say as the argument.
Simple. And it works. I still smile every time one of the office computers
says, &#8220;It is time to check&nbsp;Blackboard.&#8221;</p>

                                    <p>I came across a link to this story on Slashdot. I always enjoy reading Paul
Graham, because he writes quite simply, but obviously has the technical
knowledge and experience to write on the topics he does. This particular
article was a brief analysis of trends in the market during the DotCom Bubble
and talks a little bit about the future based on some of the market trends and
techniques from that time period. A good read, and it gives me hope that maybe
I can still get rich. After&nbsp;all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have no illusions about why nerd culture is becoming more accepted. It&#8217;s
not because people are realizing that substance is more important than
marketing. It&#8217;s because the nerds are getting <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/nerdad.html">rich</a>. But that is not going
to&nbsp;change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m overly hung-up on &#8220;getting rich,&#8221; but it sure would be
nice not to have to worry about how much I&#8217;m paying for food and whether or
not I can afford rent this month. Opposed to that, rich sounds pretty nice. If
not rich, at least &#8220;comfortable.&#8221; I also liked the quote about dressing&nbsp;informally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dressing up is not so much bad in itself. The problem is the receptor it
binds to: dressing up is inevitably a substitute for good ideas. It is no
coincidence that technically inept business types are known as &#8220;suits.&#8221; Nerds
don&#8217;t just happen to dress informally. They do it too consistently.
Consciously or not, they dress informally as a prophylactic measure against&nbsp;stupidity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So true, so true! While I fully understand the importance of appearance,
people seem to miss the seemingly obvious fact that even underdressed people
can be very talented and have good ideas. I have found in my <span class="caps">IPRO</span> that while
people need direction and leadership, they also need freedom and informality.
That way they can get their work done on their own terms. Frankly, as a
leader, it shouldn&#8217;t matter how the work gets done (within reason, of course),
as long as it gets done. Obviously there are limits to this (for example, I
require that students follow a standard comment format when writing their
code), but the idea is that most <strong>smart</strong> people work better when they can
work on their own terms. I have had managers argue with me about this, and I
have decided that dumb people exist, and that if you require someone else to
tell you how to get your work done, you must also be dumb. It is against my
policy to work with dumb people. FInally, I really like what Graham says
about young&nbsp;people:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A 26 year old may not be very good at managing people or dealing with the
<span class="caps">SEC</span>. Those require experience. But those are also commodities, which can be
handed off to some lieutenant. The most important quality in a <span class="caps">CEO</span> is his
vision for the company&#8217;s future. What will they build next? And in that
department, there are 26 year olds who can compete with&nbsp;anyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You better believe it. While I do my best to defer to my elders, I don&#8217;t think
the fact that they are 20 years older than I is a default reason for them to
make better decisions than I do. And frankly, I <strong>do</strong> know a lot more about
some topics than they do. Consustently, however, I get little or no respect
from people just because I am young. On the other hand, I am lucky in that I
have several older people who I deeply respect that also seem to respect me
and my abilities (Dr. Sun, my friend Patrick). For the rest of you who think
I&#8217;m too young to be any good at anything, how about reading a little bit of
the&nbsp;Bible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example
for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in&nbsp;purity.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1TIM+4:12&amp;language=english&amp;version=NIV&amp;showfn=on&amp;showxref=on">1 Timothy&nbsp;4:12</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take <strong><em>that!</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Update&nbsp;09/22/2004</strong></p>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span>, so the new version of Firefox (1.<span class="caps">0PR</span>) just isn&#8217;t cooperating with
TabBrowser Extensions and pop-ups. I want my pop-ups to appear in new tabs,
but I don&#8217;t want all of them blocked - especially in GMail. Despite adding the
GMail domain to the Exceptions list in the Firefox pop-up blocker, things
still won&#8217;t work. I think the problem is with TabBrowser Extensions, since
disabling it made everything work again. Anyway, in the meantime, I have tried
to find a few other smaller extensions that will emulate the TabBrowser
Extensions functionality to get around this. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m using right&nbsp;now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tabbrowser Preferences: <a href="http://www.pryan.org/mozilla/site/TheOneKEA/tabprefs/">http://www.pryan.org/mozilla/site/TheOneKEA/tabprefs/</a></li>
<li>TabX: <a href="http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info/tabx">http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info/tabx</a></li>
<li>Tab Duplicator: <a href="http://www.twannos-extensions.tk/">http://www.twannos-extensions.tk/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One minor aesthetic problem is with TabX. It just puts simple X&#8217;s for close
buttons, unlike the nice looking red buttons that <span class="caps">TBE</span> puts there. Oh well,
beggars can&#8217;t be choosers, right? I just hope that <span class="caps">TBE</span> doesn&#8217;t cause these
problems when a new version is&nbsp;released.</p>

                                    <p>Lots to talk about in this rant. I first heard of the Illinois Governor&#8217;s plan
to increase tolls in Illinois one day when I was driving to work. And this
isn&#8217;t a small increase, either &#8211; the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:B6k2O8uaf5sJ:www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-toll26.html&amp;hl=en">tolls are doubling</a>! Unless you get
an <span class="caps">IPASS</span>, of course. The solution, obviously, is to get an <span class="caps">IPASS</span>.
Unfortunately, that in and of itself presents a bit of a problem. You see,
<span class="caps">IPASS</span> tracks you. That&#8217;s my biggest beef with it. I understand the argument
that it &#8220;makes things faster&#8221; and reduces congestion, but it also records
<strong>where I go</strong>. Check the <a href="http://www.illinoistollway.com/portal/page?_pageid=53,34586,53_34725:53_34734&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL"><span class="caps">FAQ</span> </a>at their website. One part&nbsp;reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I-<span class="caps">PASS</span> users can log onto www.getipass.com or link to the online maintenance
function through the general Illinois Tollway Web site at
www.illinoistollway.com to update credit card information, add a new vehicle
to the account, or <strong>even check on recent I-<span class="caps">PASS</span>&nbsp;transactions.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This bugs me. I have no intention of ever getting arrested or anything, but if
for some reason I was, I&#8217;m fairly certain my <span class="caps">IPASS</span> records could be pulled and
used against me. This makes me angry. And despite the fact that the Tollway
Authority says they don&#8217;t track users speeds to issue tickets, I don&#8217;t trust
them. Didn&#8217;t RealNetworks claim their player wasn&#8217;t spyware at one point?
Anyway, you won&#8217;t see me buying an&nbsp;<span class="caps">IPASS</span>.</p>
<p>The day after I learned about this I decided to finally go and get my Chicago
Card, which can be used as a fare card on <span class="caps">CTA</span> busses and trains. Since I&#8217;m a
part-time student now, I don&#8217;t get a U-<span class="caps">PASS</span>, and I ride the train enough to
warrant getting one. But that made me realize the similarities between the
Toll situation and the Chicago Card. You no longer get a 10% bonus in funds
when you add 10 or more dollars to your regular <span class="caps">CTA</span> fare card &#8211; you only get
the bonus when you have a Chicago Card. But the Chicago Card is tied to your
name, so tracking is possible. With the regular fare card, they can track the
use of the card, but they can&#8217;t tie it to any one person. That&#8217;s the way I
like it. I submitted a question to the <span class="caps">CTA</span> people asking about the privacy and
information collection policies of the Chicago Card, and here&#8217;s the response I&nbsp;got:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mr.&nbsp;Butler:</p>
<p>Thank you for your inquiry. The <span class="caps">CTA</span> does not track the use of these cards by
any individual unless requested by that individual. The Chicago Card Plus does
provide its users with an online record of their usage, but each customer has
a password of his or her own selection to access the information. The regular
Chicago Card does not offer this online&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>If a law enforcement agency wishes to review our records, it can do so with
the official, lawful use of a warrant, court order,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>Thank you for your&nbsp;interest.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Terry Levin<br />
<span class="caps">CTA</span> Customer&nbsp;Service</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, this doesn&#8217;t really answer my question. So no tracking is done
&#8220;unless requested?&#8221; But what if law enforcement has a warrant to pull their
records? Is Mr. Levin saying the information doesn&#8217;t exist (i.e. users aren&#8217;t
tracked), or that it exists and isn&#8217;t used for any other purpose other than
for posterity&#8217;s sake? I don&#8217;t know. But it looks like no Chicago Card, Plus or
not, for&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>Finally, I came across <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/09/09/2217232&amp;tid=158&amp;tid=103&amp;tid=1&amp;tid=17">this story</a> on Slashdot. Apparently the city is
considering rolling out a whole bunch of cameras in the city and tying them
into the 911 call center. All good, in theory, right? It&#8217;ll help deter crime,
right? I don&#8217;t think so. Why not just put up more street lights? A bright
light is the biggest deterrant to random crime. But that would be too simple,
I guess. And lights can&#8217;t track&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>Do I sound paranoid? I am. I don&#8217;t trust the government. They&#8217;ve given me no
reason to. And government is universally corrupt, be it a national government,
a local government, or even a school administration. So it looks like I&#8217;ll be
paying a lot more than the rest of you for the same services. Yes, it&#8217;s my
choice, but the government shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to charge me for my&nbsp;freedom.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s&nbsp;worth.</p>

                                    <p>The article is in the form of a sort of sci-fi story, and is only one of
several articles (I think) that were published by the <a href="http://www.acm.org"><span class="caps">ACM</span></a>. I&#8217;m not the
biggest fan of Stallman (he&#8217;s far too big a hippie for my tastes), but I think
the article&#8217;s use of extremes illustrates some excellent points about the
tendency of government to get all up in our electronic business. Anyway, I
enjoyed it. At first glance, it seems very outlandish, but when you think
about it and read the author&#8217;s notes, it becomes clear that the sad future
isn&#8217;t far&nbsp;away.</p>
