                                    <p>Imagine my surprise when I was browsing my feeds at Google Reader today to see
the word &#8220;Pidgin&#8221; in my feeds. And in a Lifehacker post, no less! To
understand why I would be surprised, you have to remember that I grew up in
Papua New Guinea, where a trade language called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tok_Pisin">Neo-Melanesian Pidgin</a>
(Tok Pisin in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular">vernacular</a>) is spoken by roughly 4 million people
there. It is commonly referred to as just &#8220;pidgin&#8221; by people that live in&nbsp;<span class="caps">PNG</span>.</p>
<p>In reality, pidgin is a generic linguistic term that refers to a language that
develops as a means to facilitate trade in areas where many different
languages are spoken by small people groups. Since ~850 languages are spoken
in <span class="caps">PNG</span>, it makes some sense that a pidgin would be born to facilitate trade
and communication. Neo-Melanesian pidgin is based on English and German. One
of the defining characteristics of pidgins is that they are typically just a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca">lingua franca</a>, and not spoken as a first language by any people group.
Pidgins sometimes develop into creoles, which means that they then become more
full-fledged languages, because people learn to speak them as their first (and
sometimes only) language. This is the case with Haitian Creole (originally a
French Pidgin, now a French&nbsp;Creole).</p>
<p>Anyhow, the Pidgin Lifehacker was talking about is an <span class="caps">IM</span> client, much like
Trillian. Not quite what I was expecting, but given what a pidgin is, the name
is fitting.&nbsp;:-)</p>

says they&#8217;ll be working on a Linux port of Silverlight in the future. Sweet! I
was personally annoyed to find out that &#8220;cross-platform&#8221; only meant Mac and

committing to filling the Linux gap. Best of luck to&nbsp;them!</p>

                                    <p>I&#8217;ve been avoiding services like Facebook, MySpace, Friendster and the like
for a long time despite their growing popularity. In the MySpace case, it&#8217;s a
philosophical choice &#8211; MySpace sites are often so bad! They look horrible,
music plays when you go to them, the formatting is terrible… This is a natural
outcome of pure freedom; when you allow people to customize things and make
them look exactly like they want, you give them the freedom to make horrible
looking stuff. But I&#8217;m getting a bit off topic… Anyway, I avoid MySpace sort
of on principal, but I avoid Facebook due to some other reasons that I think
finally crystallized in my mind while attending a roundtable discussion at <span class="caps">MIX</span>
that included folks from Six Apart, Twitter, and&nbsp;Facebook.</p>
<p>The guy from Facebook was talking about how they view Facebook as being not an
<em>extension</em> of your identity, but rather a <em>representation</em> of it (my words,
not his; I&#8217;m trying to paraphrase the conversation). In other words, your
Facebook simply reflects the things that are happening to you, what&#8217;s going on
in your life, etc., and then shortens the gap between those events and
occurrences and the people that potentially care about you. Their philosophy
as I understand it is to reduce the amount of overhead that comes with keeping
track of what&#8217;s going on with&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a noble goal, I suppose, and one I can certainly appreciate given that
I have friends strewn all over the world (ever since the great Diaspora that
was my high school graduation in <span class="caps">PNG</span>). It certainly would be nice to always
know what was happening with those folks without ever having to do anything
about it. But I think that&#8217;s the crux of my opposition to&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>You see, I think there is a great deal of worth in getting an email after a
long time from someone who has taken the time to write you and give you a
brief update about them. It took time and energy for them to write you and
update you on their life &#8211; and I believe it shows they care. This type of rich
interaction with someone occurs more naturally after a time out of&nbsp;touch.</p>
<p>Imagine a 30-year high-school reunion if everyone was on Facebook the entire
time after graduation? Would there be anything to talk about? I suppose the
conversation would revolve around politics, religion, and other matters of
<em>opinion</em>, because life events would simply be old news. Everyone would
already know that Sam got married last summer and Mary got a new job. There&#8217;d
be no excitement in learning that Joe&#8217;s son spoke his first words last week or
that Sally was finally able to get that surgery she&nbsp;needed.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re always connected to one another all the time, it removes the
excitement and enjoyment that comes from the <em>re</em>-connecting after a
disconnect. It&#8217;s cliché, to be sure, but absence makes the heart grow fonder,
and for that reason, Facebook&#8217;s just not for&nbsp;me.</p>
