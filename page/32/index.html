                                    <p><strong>Chapter 3:&nbsp;Joel</strong></p>
<p>“&#8230;like to thank you for flying with American Airlines. We know you have a
choice when you fly and we&#8217;re glad you chose American. Enjoy your stay, and we
hope to fly again with you&nbsp;soon.”</p>
<p>Joel stirred from his light slumber and stretched his arms above him in a
wide arc. Finally, the flight was over. It was about time, too. Fourteen hours
on the plane had left him stiff, tired, and certainly not the most pleasant to
be around. But the trip was over. He wasn&#8217;t in a particular hurry to get off
the plane, so he sat back and allowed the rest of the crowd to clamor for
their&nbsp;bags.</p>
<p>That was one of many things he&#8217;d learned this trip. Time was simply not as
important as everyone seemed to think it was. Waiting patiently ten minutes
for a majority of the passengers to clear out would not negatively impact
one&#8217;s life beyond repair. But if the frenzied approach of the other passengers
was any indication, this particular philosophy was certainly not the most
popular. At least it was different&nbsp;elsewhere.</p>
<p>Joel closed his eyes and smiled, leaning his head back against the
uncomfortable hard foam of the seat. It had been a good trip. He&#8217;s learned a
<em>lot</em>, about <em>everything</em>. He didn&#8217;t know whether it was more incredible
that it had come to an end or that it had even started in the first&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>When he&#8217;d graduated high school, he&#8217;d never imagined he&#8217;d take a trip like
this. Many of his friends traveled to Europe for that summer before college,
but Joel hadn&#8217;t been able to afford it. He&#8217;d attended St. Ignatius College
Prep on a merit scholarship, and unlike most attendees, didn&#8217;t have a trust
fund. His father owned a gas station, his mother was a seamstress, and pretty
much everything about Joel&#8217;s life contrasted starkly with that of his
classmates at St.&nbsp;Ig&#8217;s.</p>
<p>But Joel was a whiz with numbers. They just made sense to him. He couldn&#8217;t
draw, he couldn&#8217;t sing, and he spelled at about a third-grade level, but he
could do wonders with numbers. At St. Ig&#8217;s, he had been led through the
magical world of mathematics by Dr. Alan Sparrow, who had impressed upon Joel
the fact that math was&nbsp;everywhere.</p>
<p>It was a fact that opened up an entire universe of opportunities to Joel.
After he realized that there were few things in life that couldn&#8217;t be broken
down mathematically, his entire world began to make sense. He began to compose
music mathematically, writing entire symphonies and handing them out to
friends to play on real instruments, because he didn&#8217;t play any himself. He
created complex formulas that, when graphed, produced wonderful works of art.
He turned his entire world into numbers, and he&nbsp;excelled.</p>
<p>During his senior year at St. Ig&#8217;s, Joel met his first girlfriend, Sara.
They hit it off immediately, and began dating exclusively after two weeks of
knowing each other. For awhile, life was good. But eventually, as he did with
all things, Joel began to analyze their relationship statistically, attempting
to find the magic formula that would allow him to make sense of the complex
interactions between&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>At first, Sara was amused and intrigued by Joel&#8217;s approach. His analytical
mind had been a major contributor in her attraction him from the start, and
his fascination with her <em>mathematically</em> was, in her words, “cute.”
Increasingly, though, Sara began to resent her role as a mere variable in
Joel&#8217;s increasingly complex formula. It became clear to her that Joel was
simply running an elaborate experiment, and she was the guinea pig. He didn&#8217;t
seem to care about her at all except in the context of his attempt to quantify
human interactions. So, in the middle of their final semester at St. Ig&#8217;s, she
explained to him that their relationship, such as it was, was&nbsp;over.</p>
<p>Sara had not been totally correct about Joel&#8217;s feelings towards her. In
reality, Joel cared very much for her. His “experiment,” as she termed it, was
really his attempt to figure the relationship out and put it into a context
that he could understand. He had a burning need to know exactly what action he
should perform in a given scenario in their relationship, and Sara simply
wasn&#8217;t telling&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>He was beside himself with depression after the breakup. His statistical
model had never, <em>ever</em>, predicted this outcome. Sara should be enthralled by
him &#8211; he was doing <em>everything right</em>! Wasn&#8217;t&nbsp;he?</p>
<p>The failure of his model to predict the breakup was a source of great
distress for Joel. It meant only one of two things; either he had made a
mistake in his abstractions or calculations, or human interaction simply
couldn&#8217;t be analyzed in terms of mathematics. Both options made him shudder.
He was fairly certain he hadn&#8217;t made any mathematical mistakes, which left
only&#8230; Joel hadn&#8217;t been able to come to terms with the possibility that he
wouldn&#8217;t be able to arithmetize human&nbsp;sociality.</p>
<p>The emotional repercussions of the unexpected breakup did not contribute
positively to his situation, so Joel had consoled himself by throwing himself
into college preparations. He&#8217;d already been accepted and was enrolled, so he
found out what classes he&#8217;d be taking, and spent most of his days that summer
in the local library reading the text books and other material for his
classes. In retrospect, it probably wasn&#8217;t the best decision. During his first
semester at college, he became <em>very</em> bored, <em>very</em> quickly. His above-
average intelligence combined with the foreknowledge of most of the material
forced him to look for other things &#8211; some of them good, most of them bad &#8211; to
keep himself&nbsp;occupied.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t long before Joel realized that more schooling simply wasn&#8217;t in the
cards for him. The nagging suspicion that mathematics weren&#8217;t everything just
wouldn&#8217;t go away, and he didn&#8217;t feel as though he were truly learning anything
in his classes that he couldn&#8217;t learn in a&nbsp;library.</p>
<p>He dropped out after his freshman year with no plans, no job, and
realistically, no real future. His uncle owned a lawn mowing business, and
Joel eventually began working there. It wasn&#8217;t especially difficult work, but
it kept Joel busy, and he had plenty of time to contemplate the questions that
were plaguing him about his approach to&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t take long for him to realize that he needed to get out and
experience the world if he wanted to try and understand it. That realization
gave birth to the trip he was now returning&nbsp;from.</p>
<p>He had saved pennies for two years to afford it. Two years of ramen,
weekends spent reading instead of going to the movies, and shirking vacation
time in favor of overtime pay. Two years of blood, sweat, and tears for this –
the trip of a&nbsp;lifetime.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Joel, the trip was all he had imagined it would be and more.
He had hiked through countless mountains, seen wonders he never thought
existed, and had met so many <em>good</em> people. The cultures of the places he had
been were so much friendlier, so much more, he thought, evolved. His smile
grew broader as he leaned back on the airline seat again and remembered the
sheer incredibility of it all. He had done&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>His thoughts were brought back to the present by the sudden realization that
all was quiet. He opened his eyes and glanced around. Nary a soul was present,
save a woman and her two uncooperative children in the section behind him. He
found his backpack, the sole possession he had with him and ambled towards the
exit of the&nbsp;plane.</p>
<p>The hustle and bustle of the airport terminal was another wake-up call. It
was now clear that he was far from the quiet jungles from which he had
recently departed. Everyone seemed in such a hurry. People brushed by him
roughly, not even stopping to apologize. It was strange, the difference
between the attitudes of those he&#8217;d met in his travels and the people that now
surrounded&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>It was a transition that he had noticed on this return trip. He had had some
trouble with his tickets on the return flight. The airline in Thailand had
suggested that he confirm his reservations with the local agent at each stop
along his itinerary, so he did. At most stops, the agents were helpful,
friendly, and understanding. One even made several frantic phone calls and
escorted him personally to his gate to make sure he made his&nbsp;flight.</p>
<p>As if he&#8217;d crossed some invisible line, the agents on the American side of
the world turned snobbish, were far less than helpful, and seemed determined
to make interaction with them a living hell. And that was only part of it. The
passengers on the domestic flights were closed off as well &#8211; they seemed to
actively avoid all contact with other passengers, content rather to cower
under their blankets and read the in-flight magazines. Joel had, on several
occasions, attempted to start a friendly conversation during a flight or while
waiting at a gate, but he was always pushed away. He had a lot of adjusting to
do before he&#8217;d feel at home again in this&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>He arrived at the terminal train station just as a shuttle was departing. Oh
well, no matter. He&#8217;d just get the next one. Stepping outside, he realized
he&#8217;d forgotten how cold the city could be at this time of year. It was in fact
quite warm, relative to the usual temperature of the city, but the gentle wind
against his bare legs and sandaled feet only accentuated the remaining chill
he had from the frosty airplane cabin. Yet another thing he&#8217;d have to readjust&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>Looking around him, he noticed several other travelers standing on the
platform, donned in light autumn jackets, each one with a serious expression,
talking on a cell phone and smoking a cigarette. Everyone seemed so isolated –
he wondered for a moment if perhaps two of the people standing there were
perhaps talking to each other, not realizing that they were in fact less then
twenty feet apart. It wouldn&#8217;t be that surprising. None of them looked at each
other. They were too engrossed in their own private conversations to care bout
or notice the rest of the world around&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Joel decided to take a short stroll around the platform while he waited. The
conversations he overheard were topically different, but equally indicative of
worried, frightened&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>“I know I&#8217;m late, Gerald. You don&#8217;t have to keep telling me. If the damn
plane had been on time, I would have made it. Well, you&#8217;ll just have to
without me for the time being. Yes, I have the portfolio. I&#8217;ll&nbsp;bring&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Did you get Mikey to school? Is he feeling better? What did the doctor say?
Was he sure it was just a cold? I&nbsp;thought&#8230;”</p>
<p>“&#8230;got me thinking, you know? I mean, it was just a little fender-bender,
no big deal, right? But the insurance company is saying that they might not
cover it, and the mechanic is charging me my left nut to get it realigned.
Yeah, I&nbsp;know&#8230;”</p>
<p>Joel shook his head. So many things to worry about &#8211; so many things to push
out of proportion. He silently wished he was back in Asia . Things seemed a
lot simpler over there. He chuckled. He was “home” less than an hour and
already complaining. That made him a true America n,&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>The train pulled up and Joel stepped on behind a tired-looking woman pulling
three large suitcases. She was trying to pull them,&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>“Could I give you a hand, ma&#8217;am?” Joel asked, placing a hand on the largest
of the three and preparing to pull it up into the train. Confused, the woman
gave Joel a quick visual appraisal and apparently judged him unworthy of the&nbsp;task.</p>
<p>“No, no, I&#8217;m fine, I&#8217;m fine. Just leave me&nbsp;alone.”</p>
<p>Joel shrugged as she moved as quickly as she could to the opposite side of
the train, sat down, and eyed him warily.&nbsp;Whatever.</p>
<p>As the train began to move towards its downtown destination, Joel found an
empty seat and sat down, peering out the window at the cars passing on the
highway alongside him. Every driver had the same serious expression as the
commuters at the station. Eyes gazing straight ahead, hands clenching the
steering wheel tightly, lead foot on the accelerator. Everyone had somewhere
to be,&nbsp;apparently.</p>
<p>Joel distracted himself by watching the autumn leaves perform complex
acrobatics in the winds above the highway. The seasons were one thing that
he&#8217;d missed while he was away. He didn&#8217;t much care for winter, and spring was
his favorite, but autumn, with its falling leaves, grey skies and clear
moonlit nights, held a special allure for him as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>He smiled to himself as he realized he&#8217;d been absent-mindedly contemplating
the physics governing the leaves movements, and reflecting on the equations
behind them. He hadn&#8217;t changed <em>that</em> much on his trip, had&nbsp;he?</p>
<p>_[Insert more Asia back story here.]&nbsp;_</p>
<p>At Allerton, the traffic on the highway had come to a complete stop. Joel
soon discovered the reason. A car was abandoned in the center lane, driver
door swung open. The drivers rolled down their windows and cursed, at who they
didn&#8217;t know, and abruptly cut off their rant when they noticed the car was
empty. The combined symphony of multi-pitched car horns was deafening. Joel
wanted to go out in the middle of it and yell at everyone to calm down.
Seriously, it wasn&#8217;t the end of the world. <em>Geez</em>.</p>
<p>As they approached the next stop, Whoorsley, Joel noticed a man running brea
thlessly towards the train from the highway entrance. <em>He&#8217;ll never make it </em>,
Joel thought as the train slowed down for the stop. As the passengers boarded
and departed, Joel poked his head out looking for the man. There was no way he
could make it without a little help. He discreetly dropped his backpack to the
floor, making sure it obstructed the door closing mechanism just enough to
prevent the train from&nbsp;departing.</p>
<p>The passengers grew increasingly agitated as the annoying prerecorded voice
said, “Doors closing,” over and over again, but no one noticed Joel&#8217;s
surreptitiously placed&nbsp;backpack.</p>
<p>The man boarded a few seconds later, and there was a sigh of relief from all
the passengers when the final “Doors closing” warning was repeated. Joel
leaned back against the train door, awash in the glow that came with doing
good deeds. His place in heaven was assured, no doubt about <em>that</em>. He&nbsp;smiled.</p>

                                    <p>This was his least favorite part of the meal, but he had to drink the
remaining milk or Rhonda would not be pleased. “Waste not, want not,” was her
motto, and she made sure Ernie ate everything he was&nbsp;given.</p>
<p>He grasped the bowl by the sides and brought the edge to his gaping mouth,
pouring as quickly and carefully as he could. He swallowed, barely, and set
the bowl on the table with a clatter as he shook his head back and forth&nbsp;violently.</p>
<p>Rhonda chuckled at the sight. She knew he hated the taste of milk, but she
couldn&#8217;t afford to have him wasting any, not with as many financial problems
as St. Ives was having. She was already stretching it just to buy him his
favorite cereal every week. But really, how could she deny&nbsp;him?</p>
<p>She couldn&#8217;t put her finger on the quality about Ernie that made him so
endearing. Perhaps it was his quiet, unassuming eyes, always hidden behind
those thick glasses. Or it could be the fact that he danced &#8211; if you could
call his carefree movements that &#8211; his way everywhere, and didn&#8217;t care at all
what others thought of him. Most likely, it was just his mind. He was a child
trapped inside a man&#8217;s body, destined never to understand the complexities of
the world. He perceived things so innocently &#8211; and struggled with even the
simplest task that involved remembering something &#8211; but he had such tenacity
that it was hard not to admire him. It was sad, in a way, that he&#8217;d never
mature past his current mental capacity, but Rhonda was careful never to pity
any of the many down-on-their-luck people she knew at St. Ives. She didn&#8217;t
believe in pity &#8211; she believed in helping&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>Rhonda thought back to 20 years ago, when she first came to St. Ives looking
to help those less fortunate than herself. She&#8217;d always had a heart for the
homeless, and St. Ives needed someone skilled in the culinary arts to help out
in the kitchen. It seemed to be a perfect fit, and for a long time it was.
That was a long time ago, when she was an attractive, idealistic
whippersnapper of a child who wanted to save the world. Much had changed since
then &#8211; now she was just struggling to keep food on the table for all the
residents, and every day seemed to drag on longer than the next. Her chance to
make a true difference was gone, and her options were dwindling even more&nbsp;quickly.</p>
<p>Thankfully, though, there were people like Ernie that appreciated the work
she did. Even if he didn&#8217;t say it, she knew he&#8217;d be lost without her and the
rest of the staff at St. Ives. And truth be told, they&#8217;d be lost without him
and the other residents as well. Their lives were inexplicably intertwined,
and Rhonda knew she could never leave St. Ives voluntarily, no matter how hard
it got or how pointless it all seemed&nbsp;sometimes.</p>
<p>The scraping of Ernie&#8217;s chair brought her back to the&nbsp;present.</p>
<p>“Ernie,” she said. “We need to talk ‘bout last night.” He&#8217;d hoped he could
escape without receiving the lecture, but he knew&nbsp;better.</p>
<p>Rhonda pulled out the chair across from Ernie and sat down heavily. Her dark
round face, framed by her bunned graying hair, was taut as she looked hard at
Ernie, but her eyes shone a compassionate gleam. He looked down at the floor,
avoiding her&nbsp;eyes.</p>
<p>“Ernie, why didn&#8217;t you come back las&#8217; night?” The questions was simple
enough. Ernie thought hard, trying to remember exactly why he hadn&#8217;t made it
back, but his mind drew a blank. “I don&#8217;t know,” he finally&nbsp;muttered.</p>
<p>“Wal, you know da rules&#8230; You know I want ya ta be back before 8. You
shouldn&#8217;t be runnin&#8217; ‘round late at night by yerself. Besides, you have a nice
warm bed here. Why you wanna sleep anywhere&nbsp;else?”</p>
<p>“I slept with Ike&#8230; he was warm,” Ernie replied, moving his head back and
forth methodically, still staring at the&nbsp;floor.</p>
<p>“Wal, jus&#8217; be sure you make it back in tonight. You know I was worried ‘bout
you. I&#8217;m just glad you&#8217;re all right.” She stood up and patted him on the&nbsp;back.</p>
<p>“Go on. I guess you&#8217;ll be going back up to the corner&nbsp;today?”</p>
<p>Ernie&nbsp;nodded.</p>
<p>“Well, come back later on. I&#8217;m baking cookies, and you might not get any if
you&#8217;re not careful.” Ernie nodded again and stood up quickly as Rhonda began
busying herself around the kitchen&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>“Bye Rhonda,” Ernie mumbled as he walked out of the kitchen. Rhonda smiled
again. One could never stay angry at Ernie for very long. She knew he didn&#8217;t
mean to stay out, and that he was sorry. He was safe, that was all that really&nbsp;mattered.</p>
<p>As soon as he left the kitchen, Ernie grasped the headphones and put them
over his ears. With a familiar flick of his index finger, he started the music
again, and jived his way on back towards 34 th and&nbsp;Broadway.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 2:&nbsp;Ned</strong></p>
<p>Beep. <em>Eggs, they&#8217;d have to wait for a minute.</em> Beep. <em>Ahh, milk, that
could go with the orange juice –- better double-bag it just in case.</em> Beep.
<em>Chips. Nothing special there.</em> Beep. Beep. Beep. <em>Load the bags in the cart&nbsp;and&#8230;</em></p>
<p>“Would you like some help getting that out to your car, Mrs.&nbsp;Jensen?”</p>
<p>“Oh no, dear, I&#8217;ll be fine. Thank you for your help. You have a nice&nbsp;day.”</p>
<p>“You too, Mrs Jensen.” Looking towards the back of the store, he was Ned was
pleased to see an empty register line. He ran his hand through his graying
hair and began to twirl his mustache. Finally a short break. His line had been
non-stop for the entire morning, and despite his affinity for hard work, Ned
needed a break. He nodded at Maria, turned off his cashier light, and walked
towards the men&#8217;s&#8217;&nbsp;room.</p>
<p>After relieving himself, he lowered himself slowly on the small bench in the
lavatory. His knee was acting up again today. He&#8217;d need to take a few more
Aspirin if he was going to make it through the rest of the&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>The door to the restroom blew open with a whoosh and in stepped Bob&nbsp;McCrane.</p>
<p>“Hey, Ned. Taking a break?” His smile was far too plastic to be genuine. Bob
was about 25 years old, and most of the cashiers resented him, Ned included.
Ned was nearly twice his age, and probably twice as intelligent, but Bob was
the boss. He knew how to kiss corporate ass like no one Ned had ever met, and
he was rewarded for it. He was always smiling, always trying to joke with
everyone, always oblivious to the fact that no one liked&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>Ned smiled wryly back. “Yes, it&#8217;s been a busy&nbsp;day.”</p>
<p>“Indeed it has. Everybody needs a break eventually, that&#8217;s the truth, mmm-
hmm. Back when I was working&nbsp;for&#8230;”</p>
<p>Ned took the cue and tuned out the rest of the inane story. All of Bob&#8217;s
stories were the same. They all eventually ended with Bob saving the day
somehow with his ingenuity, his charisma, and his I-just-won-an-Oscar smile.
Ned didn&#8217;t need to hear another one of Bob&#8217;s supposedly inspirational stories
in order to do his job better. And no story could improve his knee&#8217;s condition
– certainly not one of&nbsp;Bob&#8217;s.</p>
<p>He already took his job very seriously. In fact, he took everything in his
life seriously, but the job was especially important. Before immigrating to
the <span class="caps">US</span> , Ned had been a well-trained, well-respected mechanical engineer. He
was a wizard with mechanical structures, talented at design, and had a decent
job designing small engines for lawn mowers, cement mixers, and the&nbsp;like.</p>
<p>It was a decent life, but there were dangers too. He and Lavina just didn&#8217;t
have the kind of freedom that they truly wanted, and they wanted their
children to have the best possible opportunities available to them. Life in
the <span class="caps">US</span> seemed the best way to provide all of that, so they&nbsp;emigrated.</p>
<p>Things didn&#8217;t work out as they had planned, though. Lavina had become
pregnant early on in their new life in America , and their finances were
already strained from the journey itself. The pregnancy was long and
difficult, and hospital bills continued to pile on. Ned had been holding out
for a job related to his field of expertise, but at every interview they
turned him away, citing “lack of reliable experience.” It seemed his years in
Europe were not verifiable by the American companies, and despite his
excellent overseas references, most companies were not willing to give him a&nbsp;chance.</p>
<p>He tried everything he knew to become more desirable to the American
employers. He immersed himself in American culture, became familiar with
American mechanic style and design, and created a portfolio of impressive
ideas to present at interviews. He even changed his name to Ned, since
employers seems to have such a hard time pronouncing his real&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>Again and again, however, he was turned away. With mounting bills and a new
baby at home, Ned did the only he could &#8211; he took a manual labor job helping
out at a construction site. Most of his co-workers were either in high school
or immigrants like him. It wasn&#8217;t glamorous, but it helped pay the&nbsp;bills.</p>
<p>Ned worked incredibly hard, but he hadn&#8217;t lasted long. The knee injury from
his childhood made it nearly impossible to carry heavy loads for long
distances, a major job requirement, and he spent each evening with an ice pack
on his swelling joint. Lavina finally convinced him to try and find another
job, one that would require less physical strain. And with yet another baby on
the way, Ned knew he&#8217;d have to find&nbsp;something.</p>
<p>When Ned spoke to Jon, his supervisor, about leaving, Jon had asked his
wife, who worked as a manager at the local Dominick&#8217;s to hire him. It was a
dock in pay, and certainly not the step upwards that Ned was hoping to make,
but he was grateful for the much needed&nbsp;opportunity.</p>
<p>That was several years ago. Jon&#8217;s wife no longer worked at this particular
store, and most of the other people he&#8217;d worked with in the past had long
since moved on, but Ned had kept his job and continued to support his growing&nbsp;family.</p>
<p>It was far from the dream he and Lavina had had when they came to America ,
but Ned worked hard and earned himself quite a reputation amongst those
customers who frequented Dominick&#8217;s Store # 4534. His grocery bagging skills
had grown so legendary that new trainees were required to work with him a
minimum of 10 hours before they could start bagging items themselves, just so
they could learn the&nbsp;ropes.</p>
<p>Ned was ruthlessly committed to efficiency. He could scan, bag, and load a
customer&#8217;s groceries into their cart faster than most customers could get
their credit card out of their purse, all while holding a pleasant
conversation. He never forgot a customer, he remembered everyone&#8217;s children or
family and asked after them, and was always ready with a joke or short
anecdote to lighten someone&#8217;s mood. Not to mention his uncanny ability to fit
more items in a plastic bag than one would think possible. He knew exactly
when items required a double or even triple bag, always took extra care not to
break eggs or crush bread, and ensured all scented items were kept separate
from food items, to protect his customers from soapy tasting bread, meat and&nbsp;cheese.</p>
<p>Ned did not go entirely unnoticed for his dedication and knack for the job.
He&#8217;d been employee of the month countless times, and many customers flocked
specifically to his line at the front of the store, just so they could tell
him how their new baby girl was doing, or hear his latest joke, or ask for
prayer for an ailing relative. Many women in the local area brought cakes,
cookies, and other food stuffs for Ned and his family; yes, Ned was not
unnoticed for his hard&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>But Ned was growing old. He could feel it in his bones every morning, and he
could especially feel it as he sat down idly listening to Bob ramble on about
nothing in the men&#8217;s&nbsp;room.</p>
<p>“So how about that, huh?” Bob beamed as his story drew to a&nbsp;close.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s pretty incredible, Bob,” Ned answered idly. He had no idea what Bob
had been talking about, but all the stories were the same, and the appropriate
responses sounded nearly as rehearsed as the stories themselves by now. Of
course it was all lost on Bob. He was completely infatuated with no one but
himself, and Ned&#8217;s lack of interest didn&#8217;t faze him in the&nbsp;least.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it&#8217;s a great story&#8230; Well, I&#8217;d better get going. Lots to get done,
mmm-hmmm. Don&#8217;t dally too long, Ned. The candy around your line seems to be a
little out of whack.” Bob flashed another prize-winning smile as he dried his
hands and stepped back out of the men&#8217;s room with a&nbsp;whoosh.</p>
<p>Ned stood up slowly and gingerly put some weight on his knee. He hoped the
Aspirin would kick in soon. It was going to be a long&nbsp;day.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Chapter 1:&nbsp;Ernie</strong></p>
<p>“Are we there&nbsp;yet?”</p>
<p>Melissa sighed again. “No, baby, not yet.” The five-year-old squirmed
restlessly in the&nbsp;backseat.</p>
<p>“Mommy&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Angela, I&#8217;ve told you already. We&#8217;ll get there when we get there. Sit down,
be still, and hush up!” Melissa felt the tension in her own voice. Could it
really only be 10 <span class="caps">AM</span>? It was guaranteed to be a long day. Offhand she realized
that it had been far too long since Angela had&nbsp;commented.</p>
<p>At Lawrence &#8216;s insistence, she had taken Angela to an ear, throat and mouth
specialist, but of course he had found nothing wrong with Angela&#8217;s hearing. It
was with a certain sense of satisfaction that she had informed Lawrence of the
results. She had long since argued with him that Angela <em>could</em> listen; she
simply never <em>wanted</em> to. Lawrence, ever the idealist, desperately wanted to
believe that there was something physically hindering her obedience, rather
than accept the fact that their daughter was obstinate and overly&nbsp;excitable.</p>
<p>By now, Angela should have been bouncing off the walls, but all was quiet in
the back seat. A quick glance in the rear-view mirror revealed an enthralled
five-year-old, nose glued to the window of the beat up Chevy Astro, staring&nbsp;outside.</p>
<p>“What are you looking at?” asked Melissa as she followed Angela&#8217;s eyes to
the sidewalk outside. Melissa smiled as she realized what had caught her
daughter&#8217;s attention. On the left side of the street was a man in a faded
wind-breaker walking in their&nbsp;direction.</p>
<p>Well, he wasn&#8217;t really <em>walking</em>, he was <em>gyrating</em>. His arms flew out at
odd angles from his body, his head bobbed, Melissa assumed in time to the
music that was coming out of a pair of ancient, oversized headphones he wore
on his ears, and every so often he spun in a full circle and started the whole
process over&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>“Why is he walking like that, Mommy?” Angela&nbsp;giggled.</p>
<p>“I think he&#8217;s dancing,” Melissa replied, slowing down slightly. The quiet
brought on by Angela&#8217;s trance was something to be cherished, and Melissa
wanted it to last as long as&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>“Well, he&#8217;s not very good at it,” Angela piped up, with a slight hint of
disdain in her voice. The ballet lessons to which Melissa and Lawrence had
finally given in were paying off in many ways; not all of them were&nbsp;positive.</p>
<p>“Everyone could use practice, Angela. Not everyone is blessed with as much
talent as you are.” Melissa caught herself as soon as she said it &#8211; there was
far too much sarcasm in her voice. Thankfully, the condescension was lost on
her daughter, who was now squirming restlessly once again, her interest in the
strange man now&nbsp;gone.</p>
<p>Melissa sighed again as she pushed down gently on the accelerator. It was
going to be a long&nbsp;day.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ernie was oblivious to the curious faces peering at him as he jived his way
down Sullivan Street . He wouldn&#8217;t have cared, even if he had noticed them,
but with his headphones on he was in another world &#8211; <em>his</em> world. A world
where one couldn&#8217;t afford to be still. A world of vigorous, deliberate
movements, of spinning and twirling, of quick-stepping, of fishtailing,
bouncing, and doing it all over again. A world of glorious <em>movement</em>; when
surrounded by such miraculous music as Ernie&#8217;s, what other choice did one&nbsp;have?</p>
<p>Ernie had been out since last night. He had tried to make it back to St.
Ives, but the kids at 34 th and Broadway had been jiving late, and by the time
the last of them went inside, it was too late for Ernie to make his return
trip safely. Ken snuck him into his garage later that night, after his parents
had gone to bed, and Ernie stayed warm playing quietly with Ike, Ken&#8217;s German&nbsp;Shepherd.</p>
<p>Ken was a good friend, probably Ernie&#8217;s best. He had invited Ernie over for
dinner once, but Mr. and Mrs. van Zandt were less than thrilled having a
“dirty, disturbed man” at their home. Ernie had heard them arguing about it
from outside the house, and though he didn&#8217;t understand all the words, he knew
that he wasn&#8217;t going to be eating dinner at the van Zandt&#8217;s then or ever. Ken
had come to the door with a sad look on his face telling him that his parents
“already had dinner plans.” Ernie didn&#8217;t argue; he knew Ken didn&#8217;t have a lot
of choice in the matter. Ken&#8217;s parents had told him not to hang out with Ernie
any more, but fortunately Ken took much pleasure in doing the exact opposite
of what his parents told&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>Ernie had woken up early to make sure he made it out of the garage before
Mr. van Zandt saw him. He had wanted to stick around to jive with kids some
more, but it was too early; they were all still sleeping. He milled about the
neighborhood for awhile, but hunger eventually got the better of him, and he
started making the long trek back towards St. Ives. Rhonda was probably
worried about him&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>The perspiration was beginning to gather on his brow. It was going to be a
warm day. Ernie preferred it that way. It made him feel as though he was
working hard, even though he wasn&#8217;t. After all, work couldn&#8217;t feel <em>this</em>
good. Rhonda made him do work around the shelter every once in awhile,
landscaping and such, and she never let him listen to his music while he did
it. He hated being without his music; life was so empty, so boring without&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The first side of his cassette finished, and his trusty Walkman soon made
the familiar <em>click-pah, click-pah _ as it automatically switched to the
second side. Ernie turned the Walkman over in his hand and admired it yet
again. His rough, calloused fingers traced over the worn buttons. The text
identifying their respective functions had long since faded, but it didn&#8217;t
matter. He knew the buttons by heart anyway. The casing was scratched and
cracked, the battery cover was attached by a piece of duct tape, and the small
motor made a dull moaning sound as it spun, but the Walkman was _his</em>. It
belonged to him, and only him; it was his passport to an astounding world of
sound and&nbsp;rhythm.</p>
<p>The dull gray stone of St. Ives snuck up on him without warning. The smell
of sweetbread and chicken soup wafted gently across the street towards him,
and he salivated involuntarily. He jived his way across the way, pausing
momentarily while a taxi flew by, horn blaring. Glancing up at the flickering
neon cross above the door, Ernie pushed the large oak door open with one hand
and reluctantly pulled the large headphones from his ears. Rhonda would
already be a little annoyed that he hadn&#8217;t come in last night &#8211; there was no
need to annoy her more by keeping the headphones&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>He took the small staircase from the vestibule to the dining room two at a
time, and glanced around the small tables looking for familiar faces. Lester
was there, apparently taking a break from his occupation begging down on the
Boardwalk, and Michael too, accompanied by his ever-present collection of
assorted aluminum&nbsp;scrap.</p>
<p>Ernie briefly considered attempting to bypass the kitchen and head upstairs
to his room, then retrace his steps back downstairs to trick Rhonda into
thinking he&#8217;d been upstairs all along. Of course, it wouldn&#8217;t work. Rhonda was
already well aware that he&#8217;d been out all night, and he&#8217;d only incur more
wrath by trying to avoid her&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>So into the kitchen he went, head down in his customary ignore-the-world
fashion. He was aware of Rhonda&#8217;s stare as he moved straight towards the
cupboard and grabbed a bowl and&nbsp;spoon.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Just siddown, Ernie. I&#8217;ll git it for ya,&#8221; Rhonda said, moving towards him.
Ernie didn&#8217;t argue. He sat down with his bowl and waited patiently for Rhonda
to fill&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Rhonda walked over to the cupboard, took a nondescript Tupperware container
out, and filled Ernie&#8217;s bowl. Ernie was more than happy to do this himself,
but Rhonda knew it would take him an hour just to find the right container. No
matter how hard he tried, he could never remember which container held the
magical cereal known as Trix. On the rare occasions he did attempt to locate
the Trix himself, he was reduced to tasting each container of cereal to find
the correct&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>Rhonda poured the cereal and milk, and Ernie dug in with great fervor. Ah,
Trix&#8230; or an off-brand that tasted remarkably similar&#8230; what a brilliant
cereal! An explosion of sugary, fruity flavor in every bite! He wished that
Rhonda would give him real Trix &#8211; he could tell the difference &#8211; but Rhonda
said that Trix were for kids and Ernie, unfortunately, was no longer a kid.
How could such a wonderful dietary concoction be limited to only those under
age 13? He didn&#8217;t argue with Rhonda, though, because he had a feeling there
were other issues, most likely financial &#8211; which he would not even attempt to
decipher &#8211; at&nbsp;play.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Wal, it look dat man done done it ageen,&#8221; Rhonda shook her head back and
forth at the small television in the corner. Ernie peered up at the screen,
where the President was prattling on, looking strangely determined and
striking his hands against the podium definitively. Ernie wondered briefly
what music he was listening to that could make him move like that &#8211; if he ever
met the President, he&#8217;d have to ask to borrow the&nbsp;tape.</p>
<p>Rhonda was still shaking her head and muttering under her breath as Ernie
returned to his breakfast. Politics made the same amount of sense to Ernie as
finances, so he just avoided getting into any discussions about it. Rhonda, on
the other hand, was quite vocal about the upcoming&nbsp;election.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>How we gonna manage with dem cuttin&#8217; this, cuttin&#8217; dat, not thinkin&#8217; about
dose &#8216;round us ain&#8217;t got nothin&#8217;? How we gonna do dat, Ernie?&#8221; She didn&#8217;t
expect an answer &#8211; but the question had to be vocalized in order for it to&nbsp;matter.</p>
<p>Ernie took the last bite of his Trix and stared down at the remaining milk,
now the color of rainbow&nbsp;sherbet.</p>

month. I am participating in <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.com">National Novel Writing Month</a>, and will be
writing a 50,000-word fictional novel in the 30 days of November. The journey
will be difficult, but with your prayers I will be victorious. I am
registered at the <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.com">NaNoWriMo website</a> as dragonfly2004. Feel free to look
me up. I will be posting my manuscript in its entirety <a href="/tag/nanowrimo">on this site</a> as I
write it. Hopefully I will also have time to post some stats on how I am
doing, but no guarantees. I&#8217;d love for people to read what I write and offer
encouragement during the month, but I&#8217;d prefer if there were no comments
regarding the characters, plot, themes, or anything of the sort, because I
want to be able to focus on my vision for the month and not second-guess my
decisions while I am trying to write. Wish me&nbsp;luck.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s going to be a long&nbsp;month.</strong></p>

                                    <p><span class="caps">OK</span>, this is ridiculous. The Department of Homeland Security can&#8217;t find
anything better to do, apparently, than harass small business owners. Check
out this <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=816&amp;e=1&amp;u=/ap/20041028/ap_on_fe_st/toy_store_homeland_security">Yahoo News story</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="caps">ST</span>. <span class="caps">HELENS</span>, Ore. - So far as she knows, Pufferbelly Toys owner Stephanie Cox
hasn&#8217;t been passing any state secrets to sinister foreign governments, or
violating obscure clauses in the Patriot&nbsp;Act.</p>
<p>So she was taken aback by a mysterious phone call from the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Department of
Homeland Security to her small store in this quiet Columbia River town just
north of&nbsp;Portland.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I was shaking in my shoes,&#8221; Cox said of the September phone call. &#8220;My first
thought was the government can shut your business down on a whim, in my
opinion. If I&#8217;m closed even for a day that would cause undue&nbsp;stress.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the two agents arrived at the store, the lead agent asked Cox whether she
carried a toy called the Magic Cube, which he said was an illegal copy of the
Rubik&#8217;s Cube, one of the most popular toys of all&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>He told her to remove the Magic Cube from her shelves, and he watched to make
sure she&nbsp;complied.</p>
<p>After the agents left, Cox called the manufacturer of the Magic Cube, the
Toysmith Group, which is based in Auburn, Wash. A representative told her that
Rubik&#8217;s Cube patent had expired, and the Magic Cube did not infringe on the
rival toy&#8217;s&nbsp;trademark.</p>
<p>Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for <strong>Immigration and Customs Enforcement</strong>, said
agents went to Pufferbelly based on a trademark infringement complaint filed
in the agency&#8217;s intellectual property rights center in Washington,&nbsp;<span class="caps">D.C.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>One of the things that our agency&#8217;s responsible for doing is protecting the integrity of the economy and our nation&#8217;s financial systems and obviously trademark infringement does have significant economic implications,&#8221;</strong> she said.
Six weeks after her brush with Homeland Security, Cox told The Oregonian she
is still bewildered by the&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Aren&#8217;t there any terrorists out there?&#8221; she&nbsp;said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have several problems with this whole event. First of all, why is the
&#8220;protection&#8221; of our nation&#8217;s economy the responsibility of the government at
all, least of all the <span class="caps">DHS</span>? We&#8217;re supposed to be [relatively] free market,
right? Second, why is someone from the <strong>Immigration and Customs Enforcement</strong>
office doing the commenting? This makes even less sense! Third, it&#8217;s a Rubik&#8217;s
Cube for crying out loud! And the patent&#8217;s expired! Finally, wasn&#8217;t the <span class="caps">DHS</span>
created to safeguard our country from terrorists? Even if terrorists <strong>were</strong>
infringing on trademarks (which I seriously doubt they are), I&#8217;d still rather
the <span class="caps">DHS</span> leave them alone if they can&#8217;t actually tell a terrorist from a small
business&nbsp;owner.</p>
<p>On the other hand, had this happened to me I probably would have asked for
some paperwork or something proving they had authority to do this, but then,
we live in a culture of fear here in the <span class="caps">US</span>, so I can&#8217;t say I blame Ms. Cox
for simply complying. She hadn&#8217;t done anything wrong, after all. What did she
have to fear? (The answer is <em>everything</em>. Government sucks. And yes, I am
<a href="/2004/09/tolls-and-cameras/">paranoid</a>.)</p>
