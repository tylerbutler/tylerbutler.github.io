                                    <p>When I told people I was moving out to Puget Sound earlier this year, a common
reaction was, &#8220;I hope you like rain.&#8221; When I got here in late March, though,
the weather was beautiful, and it remained so until the last couple of weeks.
I knew it was too good to be true. To get an idea of what I&#8217;ll be dealing with
for the rest of the winter, look at what my <a href="http://www.konfabulator.com/">Konfabulator</a> weather widget

                                    <p>November is nigh upon me, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to fully participate
in <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> this year like <a href="/2004/11/tyler-a-novelist/">I did last year</a>. Between the job
and the working out, I&#8217;m simply not going to have the time for a 50,000
word novel this year. It really is a shame, since I had a couple of good
ideas. Oh well, store them up for the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>I am, however, considering trying to complete a short story during the month.
I have a few ideas&#8230; They&#8217;re listed below, along with some possible quotes
from the story and some pros and cons about doing one. After you&#8217;ve read the
descriptions, vote for your favorite on the left of the&nbsp;site&#8230;</p>
<h2>Sex, Drugs, and&nbsp;Polka</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A semi-autobiographical story about a guy who goes to
college and deals with the overall college experience. He figures most of it
out, but the fairer sex leaves him utterly confused &#8211; that is, until he meets
<em>her</em>. (This makes it sound really cheesy &#8211; I don&#8217;t think it will be once I
get it&nbsp;written.)</p>
<p><strong>Possible&nbsp;excerpts:</strong> </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Years later he would think back in awe of the
squander in which he now lived &#8211; but at this very moment, it was home, and a
good one at&nbsp;that.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>He had the fleeting thought that all men of his generation had. &#8216;Am I&nbsp;gay?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>In his heart he knew that what he really wanted was a meaningful relationship
filled with trust, sacrifice, and love, culminating in marriage and a slow
ride into the proverbial sunset of his later years with his beautiful bride;
for now, though, he&#8217;d settle for a passionate make-out session in the corner
with some girl whose name he wouldn&#8217;t remember&nbsp;tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Will give me a chance to get some of my college experiences out on
paper (with some fictional embellishments, of course) before middle-age sets
in and I forget it all. Plus, would be a lot of fun for my friends to read
since they&#8217;ll probably make&nbsp;appearances.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Far too much for a short story &#8211; I doubt I&#8217;ll ever finish it once
I start, because there&#8217;s too much material to work&nbsp;with.</p>
<h2>The&nbsp;Hill</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A children&#8217;s story about friendship. A boy grows up with a
hill in his back yard, and when he grows older, a construction company buys
the property and threatens to flatten the hill, so the boy has to find a way
to save it &#8211; or say&nbsp;goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>Possible excerpts:</strong> Hmmm, I can&#8217;t find them right now&#8230; I know they&#8217;re&nbsp;somewhere&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> I like to experiment with different styles (Mike&#8217;s character in
<a href="/tags/novel/">Knot</a> was an experiment with anger and rage), so it would be interesting
to try my hand at a children&#8217;s story, with some simpler language and richer
descriptions. The presence of a non-talking character (the Hill) would allow
me to forgo dialog and focus more on description (one of my weaker points, I&nbsp;think).</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Might be kind of boring, and difficult to prevent sounding cheesy
or overly didactic. The core concept isn&#8217;t very original&nbsp;either.</p>
<h2>The Children&#8217;s&nbsp;Democracy</h2>
<p><strong>Description: </strong>A lonely suburban writer suffers writer&#8217;s block until he
starts to observe a group of kids around his housing complex. He writes about
his observations about the way the children deal with each other socially and&nbsp;politically.</p>
<p><strong>Possible excerpts:</strong> Probably the same place <strong>The Hill</strong> excerpts are&#8230;
I&#8217;ll put them in here when I locate&nbsp;them&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Interesting concept to me, and I&#8217;d get to alternate between
analytical essay-style writing, description, and dialog pretty easily with the&nbsp;characters.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Very little subject matter to use, since I don&#8217;t have too much
interaction with kids. The idea is based on some run-ins I&#8217;ve had with some of
the kids around my apartment complex, but I don&#8217;t think I have nearly enough
material to keep this&nbsp;interesting.</p>
<p>Have another plot idea you think I should write about? Let me&nbsp;know&#8230;</p>

                                    <p>I saw this article linked over at Slashdot today and found it to be a very
interesting read. I&#8217;ve had many debates with people that think that byte-
compiled languages like Java and C# just have inherent performance problems.
Often they&#8217;ll spout off some nonsense about how garbage collection is
inefficient or something. Sure, <em>sometimes</em> it&#8217;s better to have manual control
over your memory allocation/deallocation, but this article makes a
surprisingly good case for why the perceived performance hits in dynamic
management don&#8217;t even exist. A great read, especially if you don&#8217;t know much
about how memory management works in the first&nbsp;place.</p>

                                    <p>One of the many benefits of working at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> is the relatively
little-known weight management benefit. Essentially, the benefit pays for a
large majority of a diet/weight loss/exercise program administered by the <a href="http://www.proclub.com/">Pro
Club</a>, the semi-official Microsoft sports club. I found out about it fairly
soon after I started, and I knew I wanted to get involved, but I didn&#8217;t have
the time. Finally, about a month ago, I took the plunge and got things&nbsp;going.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been overweight for as long as I can remember, and though I&#8217;ve been
relatively static the past few years in terms of weight gain, I&#8217;ve known for
awhile that I need to do something about it. Since I&#8217;m making use of all the
other Microsoft benefits (getting my teeth fixed, medical check-ups, etc) I
figured I might as well do&nbsp;everything.</p>
<p>Anyway, I officially started on the diet last Thursday and the exercise the
previous day. This week I&#8217;ve lost <strong>13.6 pounds.</strong> That&#8217;s a lot, I know, but I
should put this in perspective. I work out 90 minutes 3 days a week with a
personal trainer, and 60 minutes 3 more days a week by myself. I bought a
heart rate monitor and with the help of Jeremiah, my trainer, am learning how
to do heart-rate-focused work-outs. But the big thing last week was the&nbsp;diet…</p>
<p>Basically I ate nothing but chicken, protein shakes, and a little peanut
butter. The dietitian called it ‘detox&#8217; and she was right. I had withdrawal
symptoms including severe headaches and numbness in my hands and feet for the
first 4-5 days. It seems like most of it has passed though, and fortunately
this week I get to add veggies back into my diet. I went out for a salad at
lunch and it was quite possibly the best thing I&#8217;ve ever had in my entire life
after 7 days of chicken and protein shakes. I also talked about my aversion to
the protein shakes (I had to drink 5 per day, so I was getting pretty sick of
them) with the dietician and she moved me to another diet without the&nbsp;shakes.</p>
<p>I was having a lot of trouble keeping my calories up. I&#8217;m supposed to eat
between 1500 and 1600 a day, but last week I averaged ~1300. I was sluggish
and mentally challenged the whole week, so I am eager to get my count back up
so I can feel better while still losing the weight and eating better. I think
I&#8217;ll be a little happier now with the variety. Plus, with the veggies back and
yogurt coming back next week, I should be good to&nbsp;go.</p>
<p>I am pleased with the progress so far, but I do miss the freedom I exercised
previously when it came to food. As things go on, I&#8217;ll be adding more food
groups back in, so I should be <span class="caps">OK</span>. The weirdest thing about the whole program
is the counseling stuff. The counselor is awesome, and I only meet with here
once a month or so, but she gave me a business card that just said Sara
S&#8212;&#8211;, Psychotherapy. That word just seems scary to me, especially since I
don&#8217;t consider myself psychotic or even ‘troubled&#8217; but&nbsp;whatever.</p>
<p>Anyway, 1 week down, 19 left to&nbsp;go.</p>

celebrate, I decorated my office at work, blew up some balloons, and served

listeneing to <span class="caps">PNG</span> music in my office. Not a bad way to waste time on a slow
Friday&nbsp;afternoon.</p>
