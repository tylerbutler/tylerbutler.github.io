                                    <p>The server that is currently hosting the SharePoint version of tylerbutler.com
is being decommissioned. Unfortunately, I wasn&#8217;t given much notice about this
so I have not been able to secure an alternative SharePoint-ready location at
Microsoft to host the site. In the meantime I&#8217;ve used this opportunity to move
the site over to WordPress, and I&#8217;ve refreshed the look and feel. Hopefully
this will be temporary, since I intend to rebuild the site on the new version
of SharePoint once it&#8217;s publicly available. But in the meantime, WordPress is
serving my&nbsp;needs.</p>
<p>The main www address should be redirecting to blog.tylerbutler.com as soon as
the <span class="caps">DNS</span> changes propogate. The main <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed should be switched over, but I
have not yet moved the others. Regardless, though, you shouldn&#8217;t notice any
differences since I&#8217;m using&nbsp;FeedBurner.</p>

                                    <p>I love hearing stories. When I was growing up I used to love when people would
visit and my Dad would tell some of his stories. Even though I had heard most
of them a thousand times, it was awesome to sit back and watch other people
experience them for the first time. I also read a lot of stories growing up,
and I developed a special love for short stories in particular (I especially
like O.&nbsp;Henry).</p>
<p>While I was in college, I discovered a site that I have since lost many hours
of my life to &#8211; <a href="http://www.folklore.org/">folklore.org</a>. It&#8217;s a site put together by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Hertzfeld">Andy
Hertzfeld</a> (not to be confused with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Hertzfeldt">Don Hertzfeldt</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejected">Rejected</a>
fame), and contains &#8220;anecdotes about the development of Apple&#8217;s original
Macintosh computer, and the people who created it.&#8221; It is incredible &#8211; it
combines my love of stories with a topic I find interesting &#8211; the early days
of personal computing. Best of all, the stories there are written by the
people who experienced it, and often contain a healthy dose of humor and
humanity. But behind that, there&#8217;s some cool technical details about the
challenges the engineers faced, and why some of the decisions got made the way
they did. I find that part of it utterly&nbsp;spellbinding.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been on the lookout for other sites like this for other tech companies,
like Atari or even Microsoft. The closest I&#8217;ve found for Atari is
<a href="http://www.dadhacker.com/">DadHacker.com</a>, written by a guy who worked for Atari back in the day. His
blog is interesting in a variety of ways, but I particularly like his Atari
posts. In fact, his post titled <a href="http://www.dadhacker.com/blog/?p=987">Donkey Kong and Me</a> was what got him into
my <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader permanently. It&#8217;s good &#8211; you should read&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I actually work with a developer who was also on the team that developed
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clippy">Clippy</a>, and I&#8217;ve heard some interesting stories for him about what that
was like. Maybe I&#8217;ll try to convince him to write up some of his experiences&#8230;
I am sure there are some more great stories out there… If you know of some
sites, please do point me to&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Because I find this stuff so interesting, I thought it would be good to start
chronicling some of the stuff I know about because I&#8217;ve been working on
SharePoint. Thus, I plan to write a series titled &#8220;But Why?&#8221; about various
SharePoint features that I either worked on or have been exposed to, and why
they behave the way they do. These posts will be one part SharePoint history,
one part storytelling, and if I do it right, will pull back the curtain a bit
so you can see just why things wound up the way they&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>But first, some disclaimers: These posts are my own thoughts and opinions, and
do not reflect those of Microsoft or of anyone else who works/worked on
SharePoint. Also, my memory may be fuzzy and blatantly incorrect about some
things, so everything should be viewed through that lens. Finally, you
shouldn&#8217;t expect these posts to be as interesting as anything you read on&nbsp;folklore.org.</p>

                                    <p>Wow, it&#8217;s been awhile. Almost a year since my last post. It truly is hard to
believe. It&#8217;s been a busy year so far, but I&#8217;ve finally got some time to start
posting again. I&#8217;ve got some interesting SharePoint posts coming down the
pipe, plus a new site design I&#8217;m working on. It&#8217;s still in its early stages,
but hopefully it&#8217;ll shape up pretty soon so I can get a sample&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>One thing you&#8217;ll notice if you&#8217;ve been here before is that I&#8217;ve managed to
move the site into the 21st century by adding comments. I toyed with a few
different comment management add-ins and ended up going with <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>. It
seems like it&#8217;ll suit my needs for now, and it was pretty straightforward to
get integrated. Just added some script and markup to my master page and post
page layout in SharePoint Designer. I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about the comments
being stored separately from the site content, but it&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve got for now.
It will make migration difficult if page <span class="caps">URL</span>&#8217;s change, which they almost
certainly are when I change the architecture of the site in the next redesign.
C&#8217;est la vie, I&#8217;ll cross that bridge when I get to it. Anyway, please go ahead
and engage with me through the comments if you see something interesting on
the&nbsp;site.</p>
<p>I should also note, for completeness, that SharePoint includes a blog template
that supports comments. I, however, <a href="/2006/11/building-tylerbutlercom-on-moss/">rolled my own site</a> and didn&#8217;t use the
blog template or features. There were lots of reasons for this that I won&#8217;t go
into right now, but there are certainly some features that SharePoint blogs
have that I also want, like comments and MetaWeblog support (which I added
myself). For now, I&#8217;m stuck with what I&#8217;ve got. But like I said, there are
some exciting new things coming with my site&nbsp;redesign.</p>

                                    <p>Once upon a time, there was a very wealthy man. The man had so much money that
he bought anything and everything he could buy, and still had more money than
he could count. As he grew older and wiser, he realized he was very unhappy.
So he gathered all of his friends and confidants and asked them for their&nbsp;advice.</p>
<p>During the course of the conversation, a friend mentioned that there was a
University close by filled with struggling students. The man decided he would
give money to any student that wanted&nbsp;some.</p>
<p>The next day, the man walked to the main section of the University campus and
arranged to rent out a small room in the center of the main campus student
building, where all the students could come to get their money from him. He
then sat down on a chair in the small room and&nbsp;waited.</p>
<p>And&nbsp;waited.</p>
<p>And&nbsp;waited.</p>
<p>And&nbsp;waited.</p>
<p>For months, he would visit the campus every day and wait in the small room for
students to come and claim their money. But no one ever came. Eventually, he
became a fixture on campus. Students would smile and wave at him as they
passed by the small room; some would say hello and ask how he was. But no one
ever asked for&nbsp;money.</p>
<p>One day, while he sat in the small room, the man was approached by a student
who had always been very friendly to the man. She stopped by every day and
said hello and told him about her classes. She was always bright and cheerful.
On this day, however, her eyes were puffy and red, and she walked as though
the weight of the world was on her&nbsp;shoulders.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Sir, I just wanted to come by and say&nbsp;goodbye…&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Oh? Why&#8217;s&nbsp;that?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Well, my mom&#8217;s been really sick &#8211; and she&#8217;s better now, but my family has a
ton of hospital bills and I just can&#8217;t afford to stay here at school any&nbsp;longer.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Why didn&#8217;t you say something before? I&#8217;ve been sitting here every day for
months just waiting for someone to ask me for money, and no one ever has! Why
didn&#8217;t you ask me before?&#8221; the man&nbsp;asked.</p>
<p>The girl looked up, her eyes glimmering with&nbsp;hope.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Why didn&#8217;t <strong><em>you</em></strong> say something? How was I to know you were giving money
away unless you said something? I would never have guess that&#8217;s why you sit
here every day. But… can I have some&nbsp;money?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man smiled and pulled his checkbook from his pocket. &#8220;How much do you&nbsp;need?&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day, when the man arrived at the University, there was line of needy
students outside the small room. The line reached out the doors of the
building and wrapped all around&nbsp;campus.</p>
<p>The man asked every student why they had never come to him before, even though
they needed money. &#8220;Because you didn&#8217;t tell me that&#8217;s why you were here,&#8221; they&nbsp;said.</p>
