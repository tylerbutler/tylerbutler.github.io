                                    <p>I find myself using <span class="caps">LINQ</span> a lot in my C# code these days. I use collections all
over the place, and there&#8217;s no doubt that <span class="caps">LINQ</span> makes sorting and slicing
collections a lot simpler&nbsp;code-wise.</p>
<p>In my most recent weekend project, I need to randomly sort a list of cards,
which are represented by an <strong>Action</strong> class. After some quick searching, I
found <a href="http://www.dailycoding.com/Posts/random_sort_a_list_using_linq.aspx">some articles</a> that indicated the best way to do this would be to
sort the list by random <span class="caps">GUID</span>. This makes sense, though I certainly wouldn&#8217;t
have thought of it on my&nbsp;own.</p>
<p>The examples given all worked, but not with my lists… With the following code,
the compiler spits out several&nbsp;errors:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nb">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">Action</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">cards</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">new</span> <span class="nb">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">Action</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nx">cards.Add</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nb">new</span> <span class="nx">OneCattle</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">cards.Sort</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nx">Guid.NewGuid</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">)</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="nx">ToList</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">Action</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="nb">Error</span>    <span class="mi">1</span>    <span class="nx">Delegate</span> <span class="s1">&#39;System.Comparison&lt;agricola.Action&gt;&#39;</span> <span class="nx">does</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="k">take</span> <span class="s1">&#39;1&#39;</span> <span class="nb">arguments</span>

<span class="nb">Error</span>    <span class="mi">4</span>    <span class="nx">Cannot</span> <span class="nb">convert</span> <span class="nx">lambda</span> <span class="nx">expression</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="nx">delegate</span> <span class="k">type</span> <span class="s1">&#39;System.Comparison&lt;agricola.Action&gt;&#39;</span> <span class="nx">because</span> <span class="nx">some</span> <span class="nx">of</span> <span class="nx">the</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">types</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="nx">the</span> <span class="nx">block</span> <span class="nx">are</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="nx">implicitly</span> <span class="nx">convertible</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="nx">the</span> <span class="nx">delegate</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">type</span>
</pre></div>


<p>However, using a more explicit <span class="caps">LINQ</span> query without a lambda expression seems to
work&nbsp;fine:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="n">q</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">from</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="nx">cards</span>
        <span class="nb">orderby</span> <span class="nx">Guid.NewGuid</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="k">select</span> <span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nb">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">Action</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">r</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">q.ToList</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">Action</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Anybody know why this is? I haven&#8217;t wrapped my head around lambda expressions
and the theory behind <span class="caps">LINQ</span> to understand what the root cause&nbsp;is…</p>

                                    <p>This article, titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/05/AR2009030504104.html?hpid=topnews">Give Us a Commercial Break!</a>&#8221; from the Wall Street
Journal is <strong>way</strong> off the mark in my opinion. The article states that <span class="caps">TV</span>
shows are written with commercials in mind and that watching them without
commercials changes them. That in and of itself I can&#8217;t argue with. But I do
take issue with the implication that this is uniformly&nbsp;bad.</p>
<p>There are two core arguments in the&nbsp;article:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="caps">TV</span> shows are written with commercials specifically in mind, and removing them completely interrupts the pacing of the&nbsp;show. </li>
<li>Viewers actually like shows with ads&nbsp;better.</li>
</ol>
<p>For argument number one, it&#8217;s obvious that writers take commercial breaks into
consideration when writing <span class="caps">TV</span> shows. However, in their <span class="caps">DVD</span> counterparts, the
breaks are preserved as scene changes. These can seem rather abrupt, and I
think this points to an alternative solution: slightly longer breaks for scene
changes that are replacing commercial breaks. If we assume the normal scene
change is a second, then imagine that the commercial-break-replacement scene
change is three seconds. You can simulate this suggestion by hitting pause for
three seconds – I think you&#8217;ll be surprised at the results. I think you&#8217;ll
agree that this is uniformly better than&nbsp;ads.</p>
<p>For argument number two, I can&#8217;t refute the research. But there is a quote
from the article that is completely asinine in my&nbsp;opinion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From an audience member&#8217;s perspective, they are what makes network
television social. We use the commercial breaks to talk amongst ourselves, to
take bets on the J.D./Elliot situation and to decide that no one ever really
dies on&nbsp;&#8220;Lost.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Say what? That we need commercial breaks to be social is ridiculous. In this
day and age, we have ready access to the Pause button, and it&#8217;s a far more
useful tool for fostering discussion while watching <span class="caps">TV</span>. <a href="http://twitter.com/elizabethfrench">Elizabeth</a> and I
have been watching quite a few documentaries lately, and we pause quite often
to talk about whether or not we agree with what&#8217;s being said. I agree that
adding discussion and dialog while viewing a show is positive (there&#8217;s a
reason fans get together to watch episodes of their favorite shows), but I
think people use the commercial breaks because they&#8217;re there, not because they
<strong>need</strong> them in order to have that conversation&nbsp;successfully.</p>
<p>I hate ads in all forms (though I can appreciate particularly clever or well-
done ones), so I am definitely biased here. But seriously&#8230; there&#8217;s a reason
<span class="caps">DVD</span> copies of shows sell so well, and it isn&#8217;t because people are dying to own
season one of “Scrubs” for&nbsp;eternity&#8230;</p>

                                    <p>The server that is currently hosting the SharePoint version of tylerbutler.com
is being decommissioned. Unfortunately, I wasn&#8217;t given much notice about this
so I have not been able to secure an alternative SharePoint-ready location at
Microsoft to host the site. In the meantime I&#8217;ve used this opportunity to move
the site over to WordPress, and I&#8217;ve refreshed the look and feel. Hopefully
this will be temporary, since I intend to rebuild the site on the new version
of SharePoint once it&#8217;s publicly available. But in the meantime, WordPress is
serving my&nbsp;needs.</p>
<p>The main www address should be redirecting to blog.tylerbutler.com as soon as
the <span class="caps">DNS</span> changes propogate. The main <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed should be switched over, but I
have not yet moved the others. Regardless, though, you shouldn&#8217;t notice any
differences since I&#8217;m using&nbsp;FeedBurner.</p>

                                    <p>We&#8217;ve changed the way we&#8217;re managing and releasing updates here in the
SharePoint team. This is all very good news. It makes things more manageable
internally for us, which translates into quicker, more effective turnaround on
issues, but it also means that updates and patches will be much more
predictable, so you can plan around those dates more effectively. There is
still recourse for you if you have an absolutely critical issue that needs to
be resolved&nbsp;<span class="caps">ASAP</span>.</p>

                                    <p>I love hearing stories. When I was growing up I used to love when people would
visit and my Dad would tell some of his stories. Even though I had heard most
of them a thousand times, it was awesome to sit back and watch other people
experience them for the first time. I also read a lot of stories growing up,
and I developed a special love for short stories in particular (I especially
like O.&nbsp;Henry).</p>
<p>While I was in college, I discovered a site that I have since lost many hours
of my life to &#8211; <a href="http://www.folklore.org/">folklore.org</a>. It&#8217;s a site put together by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Hertzfeld">Andy
Hertzfeld</a> (not to be confused with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Hertzfeldt">Don Hertzfeldt</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejected">Rejected</a>
fame), and contains &#8220;anecdotes about the development of Apple&#8217;s original
Macintosh computer, and the people who created it.&#8221; It is incredible &#8211; it
combines my love of stories with a topic I find interesting &#8211; the early days
of personal computing. Best of all, the stories there are written by the
people who experienced it, and often contain a healthy dose of humor and
humanity. But behind that, there&#8217;s some cool technical details about the
challenges the engineers faced, and why some of the decisions got made the way
they did. I find that part of it utterly&nbsp;spellbinding.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been on the lookout for other sites like this for other tech companies,
like Atari or even Microsoft. The closest I&#8217;ve found for Atari is
<a href="http://www.dadhacker.com/">DadHacker.com</a>, written by a guy who worked for Atari back in the day. His
blog is interesting in a variety of ways, but I particularly like his Atari
posts. In fact, his post titled <a href="http://www.dadhacker.com/blog/?p=987">Donkey Kong and Me</a> was what got him into
my <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader permanently. It&#8217;s good &#8211; you should read&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I actually work with a developer who was also on the team that developed
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clippy">Clippy</a>, and I&#8217;ve heard some interesting stories for him about what that
was like. Maybe I&#8217;ll try to convince him to write up some of his experiences&#8230;
I am sure there are some more great stories out there… If you know of some
sites, please do point me to&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Because I find this stuff so interesting, I thought it would be good to start
chronicling some of the stuff I know about because I&#8217;ve been working on
SharePoint. Thus, I plan to write a series titled &#8220;But Why?&#8221; about various
SharePoint features that I either worked on or have been exposed to, and why
they behave the way they do. These posts will be one part SharePoint history,
one part storytelling, and if I do it right, will pull back the curtain a bit
so you can see just why things wound up the way they&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>But first, some disclaimers: These posts are my own thoughts and opinions, and
do not reflect those of Microsoft or of anyone else who works/worked on
SharePoint. Also, my memory may be fuzzy and blatantly incorrect about some
things, so everything should be viewed through that lens. Finally, you
shouldn&#8217;t expect these posts to be as interesting as anything you read on&nbsp;folklore.org.</p>
