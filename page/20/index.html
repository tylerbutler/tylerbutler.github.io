                                    <p>Several of my banks have been &#8220;upgrading&#8221; their security since the beginning
of the year. I have pretty much accepted the fact that &#8220;upgrading&#8221; security
means my blood pressure will needlessly rise the next time I try to access my&nbsp;account.</p>
<p>The latest security craze seems to be these security questions. &#8220;Mother&#8217;s
maiden name&#8221; apparently doesn&#8217;t cut it anymore. Security questions drive me
insane, because there&#8217;s invariably a finite set of options I have to choose
from. <em>Favorite childhood superhero?</em> <em>Name of firstborn child?</em> What is this
crap? <strong>None</strong> of it is easy for me to remember! Why don&#8217;t you let me pick my
<strong>own</strong> question and my <strong>own</strong> answer? Now I have to remember some &#8220;fact&#8221;
that I made up as an arbitrary answer to some stupid question that a bank
decided was an excellent way to distinguish me from some sorry&nbsp;thief.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, many times I have to select<strong> two or more</strong> security
questions. <strong><span class="caps">OMG</span>. <a href="/2004/08/i-hate-banks/">I hate banks so&nbsp;much.</a></strong></p>

                                    <p>My pledge bro Craig &#8220;Rizzy&#8221; Rohe also has a Wii, and he sent me some mini-reviews on some games. Since he has no online presence (yet), I thought I&#8217;d
post them. But before I do that, here&#8217;s what he has to say about getting
online with the&nbsp;thing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, some bitching about&nbsp;Wii:</p>
<p>Up until 10 minutes ago, all I&#8217;ve ever done with the Wii is played games.
Very easy, very fun. However, trying to use the internet connectivity and
adding friends made me want to punch a little Japanese person in the face. Do
they actually expect average people to be able to do this? I&#8217;m an embedded
systems designer, and I was frustrated with it. Other than letting our Mii&#8217;s
travel back and forth, is there even any benefit to doing it? Shame on you&nbsp;Nintendo.</p>
<p>Second, games only save to the internal Wii memory. If you want them on the
<span class="caps">SD</span> card, you have to copy it over manually. Of course, you&#8217;d have to do that
each time you play the game in order to keep the <span class="caps">SD</span> card up to date. It pretty
much makes the $50 1G memory card I bought completely&nbsp;useless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t have said it better myself. The Wii online setup is pretty bad. I&#8217;m
really surprised people are getting it to work without wanting to gouge their
own eyes out with a spoon. As for me, I am still using it on my neighbor&#8217;s
wireless because it won&#8217;t work on mine. And yes, I have changed to channels
1/11 on the router. Yes, I have followed all stupid suggestions in the forums
and on the support site. Nintendo could take a few pointers from Microsoft in
this particular part of the&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">SD</span> thing seems strange. I haven&#8217;t tried to use an <span class="caps">SD</span> card yet, but it does
seem odd that you can&#8217;t save games directly to it. This does seem like
something Nintendo could fix change with a firmware update&nbsp;though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Wii Sports</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s ok. Fun little games to showcase the controller
abilities. I&#8217;ve found tennis to be pretty fun with multiple people, and you
can avoid the dreaded Wii tennis elbow once you learn that a skilled flick of
the wrist will do just as much as a full blown swing. I brought my Wii home
for Christmas, and since I have a zillion siblings we had continuously
rotating doubles matches which were a&nbsp;blast.</p>
<p><strong>Super Monkey Ball</strong> &#8211; I usually only play the mini games. Not as much fun
as the versions for GameCube. I think they tried too hard to incorporate the
motion control into the games, and many of them are just too touchy, or they
should have put more time into making it fun. I guess they were pressed for
time trying to get that one out for launch. There are a few that are pretty
entertaining&nbsp;though.</p>
<p><strong>Zelda: Twilight Princess</strong> &#8211; This game rocks. It&#8217;s hella fun to play. They
used the motion sensors in moderation, which is good. The game itself is
really fun - plenty of puzzles and tangent adventures to try out. I haven&#8217;t
played any Zelda games since the one for 8-bit Nintendo, but I can still
blindly say this is probably the best to&nbsp;date.</p>
<p><strong>Excite Truck</strong> &#8211; So much fun my head almost exploded. It&#8217;s a very fast
paced, physics defying game. There&#8217;s actually a lot of strategy needed for the
more advanced tracks, but at the same time you can just pick a level and have
fun doing 720&#8217;s at 1000 ft in the air and smashing through trees with power-
ups. Definitely one of the best games I&nbsp;own.</p>
<p><strong>Red Steel</strong> &#8211; I haven&#8217;t played this game very much. The reason? My damn
arm gets tired. Another example of how not to design a game interface. I think
it would be much better if I could play for more than 20 mins at a time, so my
review may be biased. Basically, you are required to use the Wii-mote pointer
continuously to aim and steer in the game. That&#8217;s not even too bad because you
could rest your arm on your knee; then they thought up the great idea of
requiring you to extend your arm towards the <span class="caps">TV</span> to zoom in/out. Combine all of
that movement and you have to hold your arm straight out for extended periods
of time during game play. Very annoying. Maybe I need to hit the&nbsp;gym.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Haven&#8217;t gotten into Twilight Princess yet myself. Elebits should be here from
<a href="http://www.gamefly.com/">Gamefly</a> this week, though in retrospect maybe I should have put Excite
Truck at the top of my queue instead. Oh well, way too many awesome games
these days to get to. I still work occasionally, you&nbsp;know.</p>

                </header>
                                    <p>One of the things that really annoys me about iTunes is the lack of
categorical tagging. Actually, I shouldn&#8217;t blame iTunes. I think this is a
fundamental limitation in the <span class="caps">ID3</span> tags. What I want is the ability to &#8220;tag&#8221;
music as I listen to it, with terms like &#8220;story-song&#8221; (songs that tell a
story) or &#8220;ricardo&#8221; (songs that my friend Ricardo has introduced me to).
Social music sites like <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a> have this concept, as
does just about every &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; site in the world. Why not my music&nbsp;player?</p>
<p>Initially when I tried to implement this sort of thing I used the &#8220;keywords&#8221;
field. I would just add the tag to that field, then I created Smart Playlists
based on that field. <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/itunes/tag-your-songs-in-itunes-153970.php">This post at Lifehacker</a> suggests using the
&#8220;Grouping&#8221; field, but the premise is the&nbsp;same.</p>
<p>This approach works fine until you want to edit a bunch of songs and <strong>add </strong>a
tag. When you do a bulk edit of the keywords field in iTunes it&#8217;ll overwrite
anything that was there previously. So suddenly tagging all that music with
&#8220;<a href="/music/Pages/SasquatchMusicFestival2006.aspx">Sasquatch 2006</a>&#8221; removed all the other cool tags you had applied. Major&nbsp;suckage.</p>
<p>Today I decided to try a new approach: I just use dumb, old-fashioned
playlists. When I want a new tag, I create a new playlist for it. For
organization purposes I keep all tag playlists in a folder called Tags. I can
then create additional nested folders for categories, and because of how
iTunes handles folders with playlists inside, the folders will become
aggregators of all the music in playlists underneath them, which is nifty.
This means I can see all of the music I have tagged just by clicking the Tag&nbsp;folder</p>
<p>This approach is pretty simple. Adding a tag is easy, and using the tags to
drive smart playlists is easy too. Just add an &#8220;If &lt;<strong>Playlist</strong>&gt; &lt;<strong>is/is
not</strong>&gt; &lt;<strong>Tag playlist name</strong>&gt;&#8221; clause to the Smart Playlist. There is a
drawback, though&#8230; <strong>Removing </strong>tags is now a pain. From the frying pan into
the fire&#8230; I have to make sure the song doesn&#8217;t appear multiple times in a
playlist, and if it does, remove all occurrences. This is because playlists
are designed to support multiple occurrences of the same song. If I want to
start and end my playlist with <em>My Heart Will Go On</em>, then dang it, I can do
it. But for my purposes, it&#8217;s not the ideal&nbsp;behavior.</p>
<p>Anyway, none of this really helps my situation, because the iTunes app
<strong>doesn&#8217;t help me</strong> manage my tags, build playlists based on them, or
anything, natively. All of this is a hack. There are a lot things that it
could do to make it easier to tag music. And with the iTunes music store, what
if I could check out how other users were tagging the track, and borrow their
tags? This is all stuff that is provided by Last.fm, of course, but Last.fm
doesn&#8217;t manage my entire music collection - iTunes&nbsp;does.</p>
<p>And of course <strong>none </strong>of this does anything on my iPod. Heck, <strong>it </strong>can&#8217;t
even understand playlist folders, which is super <em>super <strong>super</strong></em> dumb.
Actually, I have a lot of gripes about the iPod&nbsp;<span class="caps">UI</span>&#8230;</p>

                                    <p>If you browse around the internet these days, you&#8217;re bound to come across a
website that has an intro page. Usually this page allows you to choose whether
you have a high- or low-bandwidth connection. If you select the high-bandwidth
option, you invariably get taken to a Flash version of the site, while the
low-bandwidth version of the site is static&nbsp;<span class="caps">HTML</span>.</p>
<p>When faced with these types of choices, I often forget that one should <em>always
_pick the low-bandwidth option, even if one is using a high-bandwidth
connection. The main reason is that these Flash sites often have annoying
background music or annoying animations. From a site design perspective, Flash
is best used as a _supplementary</em> web technology. A website shouldn&#8217;t be
designed entirely in Flash. Some core reasons for this are accessibility and
search-ability. Google and other spiders cannot crawl a flash web site as
easily. Not to mention the fact that these types of sites always have some
crazy navigation scheme and flashy transitions between sections that make it
very difficult to navigate around, because it doesn&#8217;t fit the typical web
mold. Finally, Flash sites are typically absolutely scaled at a specific
resolution, which means they don&#8217;t look or work great if they&#8217;re not at a
specific window size. To combat this, they&#8217;ll pop open a separate browser
window at the specific size they want. Talk about annoying! There is very
rarely <em>any</em> need at all to design your site in Flash completely. Many 
Flash-only site have a stripped down <span class="caps">HTML</span> version of the site, hence the intro page
where you pick which version you want to see. Since you already have to create
an <span class="caps">HTML</span> version of the site, why not scrap the flash site and focus your
attention on making the <span class="caps">HTML</span> site much&nbsp;better?</p>
<p>The trend of completely Flash-based web sites has declined dramatically in the
commercial web of late, which is a great development. Instead, sites are using
Flash as a way to add a bit of pizzazz to the site in strategic places, or to
add a slightly more interactive portion to their site. Judicious use of Flash
in this way is&nbsp;good.</p>
<p>The next time someone tells you that you should design your entire web
presence in Flash, or have two versions of your site, shoot&nbsp;them.</p>

                                    <p>I had to buy a new tube of toothpaste the other day. This isn&#8217;t something I do
terribly often. I live alone, and even with my braces, which requires a more
stringent dental hygiene regiment, I don&#8217;t go through a tube that&nbsp;quickly.</p>
<p>But as I browsed the seemingly endless toothpaste section at my local Fred
Meyer, looking for a tube, I realized that I have never bought the same type
of toothpaste twice. I get to the store and I realize that I don&#8217;t know what
type I bought last time, and all of the tubes look the same and have
frustratingly similar names. <em>Did I get Mint Zing last time? Or was it Fresh
Mint? Maybe it was Minty Fresh… Yeah, it was Minty&nbsp;Fresh.</em></p>
<p>Nope, it wasn&#8217;t Minty Fresh. It wasn&#8217;t even Fresh Mint or Mint Zing. It was
<strong>Mega Mint with Scope, Baking Soda and Peroxide Whitening ++</strong>. <em>Sigh</em>. Why
does it have to be so hard to buy freaking&nbsp;toothpaste?</p>
