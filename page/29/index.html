                                    <p>Ahhh, Christmas, a time for food, family, and of course, gifts. Some of my
friends this year, however, are giving me gifts that <strong>cost</strong> me money. These
gifts come in the form of mobile phone text messages, which are not included
in my cell phone plan. T-Mobile charges me 50 cents a pop for every one sent
<strong>and</strong> received. Many of my friends have sent me Christmas greetings the past
few days via text message, and I can just see the ogres at T-Mobile jumping
with glee as my bill skyrockets. Oh well. At least I have&nbsp;friends.</p>

                                    <p>If you&#8217;ve been at <a href="http://www.iit.edu" title="The Illinois Institute of Technology homepage, the virtual home of the distinguished learning institution I call my own.">Illinois Tech</a> this week, you&#8217;ve had the absolutely
wonderful opportunity to see what carnage a Denial of Service attack against a
core <span class="caps">DNS</span> server can create. Now, I honestly don&#8217;t know much about network
infrastructure or the mechanics behind a Denial of Service attack; frankly, my
passion is software, not hardware, so I&#8217;ve never sought out the knowledge.
(Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com" title="Find out how stuff works!  Go on, learn a little!">HowStuffWorks.com</a> doesn&#8217;t have anything specific on DoS.
They do, however, have articles on <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/router.htm" title="How routers work.">routers</a>, <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/firewall.htm" title="How firewalls work.">firewalls</a>, and
&#8220;<a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet-infrastructure.htm" title="How the internet works.">Internet Infrastructure,</a>&#8221; for those that want to learn more about the
hardware that makes the Internet work.) But despite my lack of knowledge, this
past week has been an excellent chance to experience the effects a DoS can&nbsp;cause.</p>
<p>A DoS <strong>destroys</strong> your ability to use the network &#8211; much moreso than I ever
thought possible. For my own sake, I am going to write a little bit about what
I&#8217;ve seen and make some conclusions about what went wrong, and even try to
suggest possible solutions that we can implement to solve things in the
future. But before we start, a little disclaimer. The network people here at
<span class="caps">IIT</span> are not the most apt people in the world, but they&#8217;re not the most inept
either. We do have some truly brilliant people around here, but frankly, they
don&#8217;t get recognized or listened to nearly enough. So before you start railing
on the fact that if <strong>you</strong> were a network engineer here, this never would
have happened, let me say this: the main problem I have seen this past week is
not a lack of technical experience, knowledge, or anything like that; the
problem is a <strong>lack of communication.</strong> I cannot stress that enough. So let&#8217;s
get&nbsp;started.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening, Felix, one of our network engineers, noticed an inordinate
amount of traffic to random ports and stuff, and suspected a worm or virus had
made its way onto the network. In an effort to contain the attack, he blocked
the <span class="caps">MAC</span> addresses of 160 computers with the highest traffic on the network at
the time, effectively banning <strong>all</strong> network traffic from those people. The
thought was that this would diagnose the problem &#8211; block the addresses, watch
things go back to normal, then go through the <span class="caps">PC</span>&#8217;s that were blocked and
figure out what worm or virus had caused the problem, fix it, and reopen the&nbsp;network.</p>
<p>Problem was &#8211; blocking the addresses didn&#8217;t fix the problem. In fact, it got
worse. The <span class="caps">DNS</span> server started going down, and then finally went kaput
altogether. This effectively knocked out internet access for all of campus.
The internal network still worked, and some cached <span class="caps">DNS</span> entries still resolved
all right, but most people were locked out. Here at the Support Desk we got
back up and running for awhile by switching to an external <span class="caps">DNS</span>, but we
couldn&#8217;t exactly tell the whole campus to do that, because it wouldn&#8217;t have
solved the root of the problem. Eventually, because of the bogus traffic that
was being spit out from our network and our <span class="caps">DNS</span> server, our own <span class="caps">ISP</span> blocked
our <span class="caps">DNS</span>&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>This is where things started to go downhill &#8211; fast. Felix provided us with the
list of blocked <span class="caps">MAC</span> addresses initially, but by the time the <span class="caps">DNS</span> went down,
which was late Monday afternoon, that list was out of date. On top of that,
because of the rampant random network issues, we couldn&#8217;t tell a customer what
was wrong when they called. They might be blocked, they might not. It might
just be the random <span class="caps">DNS</span> problems, it might not. We had still not been provided
with a process through which people could get checked and unblocked if
necessary. Thus, problem number&nbsp;one:</p>
<p><strong>1) We at the Support Desk were not provided with information, sketchy or
otherwise, to tell people when they&nbsp;called.</strong></p>
<p>So we started telling people whatever we knew &#8211; there were network issues,
there were some people with blocked <span class="caps">MAC</span>&#8217;s, we didn&#8217;t know when things would be
back up. It is useful to remember that at this point, <span class="caps">OTS</span> had no idea what the
problem was (the <span class="caps">DNS</span> server was the <em>problem</em>, but it had been brought down by
the DoS attack, which hadn&#8217;t been identified yet), and no information had been
sent out to the <span class="caps">IIT</span> community. Hence, problem number&nbsp;two:</p>
<p><strong>2) <span class="caps">OTS</span> was extremely slow at getting public information out to the <span class="caps">IIT</span>
community, and when they did, provided it via unreliable methods (email,&nbsp;mainly).</strong></p>
<p>Yup, most information went out in the form of emails, which is certainly a
valid form of communication, but it shouldn&#8217;t be the only one. But more on
suggestions&nbsp;later&#8230;</p>
<p>As the week dragged on, and more and more customers became agitated from a
lack of information and a seeming lack of action on our part, things just got
worse. Apparently, there was much debate about the actual cause of the problem
was. Virus scans and other searches had revealed nothing on many of the
blocked <span class="caps">PC</span>&#8217;s, except a small <span class="caps">VBS</span> worm that remained under most virus scanner&#8217;s
radar. One camp held that there was just a problem with the <span class="caps">DNS</span> server -
something was wrong with it. The other camp held that we were under an attack.
One &#8211; it&#8217;s our fault, two &#8211; it&#8217;s not our fault (at least, not&nbsp;directly).</p>
<p>It was suggested at this point that we remove the <span class="caps">DNS</span> server and replace it
with a fresh one, which would make the choice between the two theories simple.
But, for some unknown reason, this was resisted for quite some time.
Eventually, a new <span class="caps">DNS</span> server was put in. It lasted 30 minutes. It was clear we
were under attack. Thus, point number&nbsp;three:</p>
<p><strong>3) When <span class="caps">DNS</span> went down, it should have been replaced immediately. That
would have made it clear from the beginning that we were under&nbsp;attack.</strong></p>
<p>During all of this hullabaloo, we at the Support Desk remained ignorant of any
information regarding the problem, its causes, and what <span class="caps">OTS</span> was doing to
resolve it. The calls we received were getting angrier and angrier as final&#8217;s
week loomed closer and they still couldn&#8217;t get to their course websites, or do
research, or browse the net to relax, or anything. In addition, we didn&#8217;t have
an updated <span class="caps">MAC</span> block list, which had been changed (at one point it got to 400
<span class="caps">MAC</span>&#8217;s) several times at this point. Points numbers four and&nbsp;five:</p>
<p><strong>4) The Support Desk was not provided with up-to-date information (such as
updated <span class="caps">MAC</span> block lists) that would have assisted them in diagnosing the
problem(s), and cut down the workload on other <span class="caps">OTS</span> divisions, and maybe, just
maybe, would have left customers feeling a little happier about the state of&nbsp;things.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5) When <span class="caps">OTS</span> Communications went out, they were overly vague and seemed to
take forever to write. Communications went out with information that seemed
out of date as a&nbsp;result.</strong></p>
<p>Well, those are the main points. The core problem was a lack of communication
and information-sharing amongst departments. If the Support Desk is a voice
for <span class="caps">OTS</span>, then we have to know what to say, and we simply weren&#8217;t provided with
any information. Also, (and this really bugs me) the <span class="caps">OTS</span> communications just
told people to call the Support Desk if they had a problem, presumably to get
more information, but we didn&#8217;t have anything to tell them. So these were the
problems, now what about solutions? Here are my thoughts, for what they&#8217;re&nbsp;worth.</p>
<p><strong>Provide the Support Desk access to information such as <span class="caps">MAC</span> block lists.
The info has to be <em>up-to-date</em>, otherwise it&#8217;s not really&nbsp;useful.</strong></p>
<p>This seems to be a no-brainer to me. If we&#8217;re going to be sending out emails
that say, &#8220;Call the <span class="caps">OTS</span> Support Desk for assistance in troubleshooting your
network access,&#8221; then the Support Desk has to have up-to-date information
about it. If people are going to be calling with their <span class="caps">MAC</span>&#8217;s, we can&#8217;t be
looking at a list over a week old. In fact, it was just this morning that we
finally got the updated list, <em>after</em> it had grown to over 400 people and
shrunk back down to about&nbsp;25.</p>
<p><strong>Make one person responsible for communicating with the&nbsp;students.</strong></p>
<p>By this, I don&#8217;t mean that one person should be taking calls with problems.
That&#8217;s the Support Desk&#8217;s job. What I mean is that one person should write the
communication emails, and should be responsible for getting accurate
information from the appropriate people to send out. The process would be as
follows: Network goes down&#8230; Communicator calls Networks, finds out problem X
is the cause, gets an <span class="caps">ETA</span>&#8230; Communicator sends out email information, and
makes arrangements to notify via other means. See below. The more I think
about this, someone at the Support Desk should have this responsibility. But
it should only be one&nbsp;person.</p>
<p><strong>Communication should be done through a variety of&nbsp;means.</strong></p>
<p>In this instance, email was, and usually is, the primary form of
communication. But we need to send out voice mail to faculty, put up flyers in
<span class="caps">MSV</span> and <span class="caps">SSV</span>, and, dare I say it, <strong>hold a press conference</strong>. This isn&#8217;t
always necessary, but in this case, it would have been nice if students could
have gone to a public meeting one evening in the <span class="caps">MTCC</span> auditorium or something,
heard a brief statement about what the problem was and what action we were
taking, and had a chance to ask questions and get some straight answers.
People who aren&#8217;t in the dark are less likely to make up their own
explanations for why something went wrong. Ending speculation can help end
angry customer&nbsp;calls.</p>
<p>I guess that&#8217;s really all I have. This week has been trying for all of us here
at <span class="caps">OTS</span>, but I hope that maybe the staff here will learn from this experience
and make it better the next time this happens. But of course, I am just a
lowly peon here, so what do I&nbsp;know?</p>
<p>By the way, for anyone that cares: <strong>The problem was caused by some (like
8-10) PCs on campus getting hacked (externally, internally, who knows) and
participating in a DoS attack against the <span class="caps">DNS</span> server. The problem now seems to
have been contained, and about 25 people still remain blocked.</strong> Yeah, DoS
sucks, but it is kinda cool to realize that 8-10 machines can destroy a
network connection serving a university of 3000 people. <em>Kinda</em>&nbsp;cool.</p>

                                    <p>I started looking at some open-source software and came across Blender, a
cool-looking 3D modeling program. On <a href="http://www.blender3d.org/" title="Blender looks pretty cool.  Too bad I don't have any artistic skills...">their homepage</a>, I noticed this image
(it may no longer be on their&nbsp;page):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/SiteCollectionImages/Post%20Images/then%20than.jpg" /></p>
<p>Now what&#8217;s wrong with this picture? Well, the designer of the image was not
very careful when selecting the words to use. The words &#8220;than&#8221; and &#8220;then,&#8221;
while differing only by one letter, are vastly different in meaning. <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=then" title="Check the meaning of then at dictionary.com.">Then</a>
is most commonly an adverb, but can sometimes be a noun or adjective (time-
related). <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=than" title="Check the meaning of than at dictionary.com.">Than</a>, on the other hand, is a conjunction, used to compare
things. <em>I am better at English <strong>than</strong> you are</em>, for example. So when you
want to compare things, as the person making this advertisement image
apparently wanted to, you want to use&nbsp;than.</p>
<p>I think the confusion regarding this stems from the use of &#8220;then&#8221; as a time-
related adjective or noun. For example, &#8220;I was there then,&#8221; or &#8220;the then
director of <span class="caps">OTS</span>&#8221; are valid uses of the word, which confuses people when they
want to compare things, especially in time-related constructs, such as &#8220;more
than before.&#8221; Then implies a previous state of being, so previously &#8211; then -
there were less than there are now. This, I think, is the root of the
confusion. If you really want to get your head spinning, try this: &#8220;There were
more employers there then than previously.&#8221; I <em>think</em> that&#8217;s grammatically
correct, but many people seem to get this confused. It could also be that they
are often pronounced similarly if not exactly the same, so drill yourself on
it if you&#8217;re having problems&nbsp;remembering.</p>
<p>Since I have noticed some common grammatical and language-related mistakes at
work, in the <span class="caps">IPRO</span>, and just on blogs and websites in general, I think I might
start a regular column on here with common problems people have with similar
sounding, yet different meaning words. After all, I am the master of all that
is English. And I <a href="/tag/novel" title="Check out Knot, the novel I wrote as part of NaNoWriMo">wrote a novel</a>.</p>

it out in InDesign or something to make a nice <span class="caps">PDF</span> booklet. I am also going to

book. But that&#8217;s in the future. I know at least one or two people have been
following along throughout the month, so now is the time for you to let me
have it&#8230; I will be putting some polls up soon for people that have read the
novel, but if you want to compliment me or criticize me for anything in the

so the additions are listed here along with the chapter in which they go. The
<span class="caps">PDF</span> has been updated with all the new&nbsp;material.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 29:&nbsp;Epilogue</strong></p>
<p>Angela was bobbing up and down in her chair almost uncontrollably as Melissa
came down the stairs into the kitchen. Lawrence , of course, sat reading a
paper next to her, ignoring her completely as she knocked plates, cups, and
other random items on the table to the floor with her&nbsp;movement.</p>
<p>“Angela, settle down and eat your brea kfast!” Melissa knew it wouldn&#8217;t
happen. The five-year-old looked down in disgust at the strange mixture of
foodstuffs on her plate. The toast was now soggy from spilled apple juice, and
the remaining bits of egg swam in a pool of juice as well. Angela turned her
nose up at the plate primly and crossed her arms across her&nbsp;chest.</p>
<p>She was pouting at the reprimand. Melissa rolled her eyes at her daughter&#8217;s
silliness and flipped on the small television in the room, pushing down two
slices of brea d in the toaster as the picture faded&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>“Can we watch cartoons,&nbsp;mommy?”</p>
<p>“No, we cannot,” Melissa responded fla tly. The question was asked each
morning, and the answer always remained the same. But Angela nev er gave up;
one day her mother would relent, and she would get to watch cartoons while she
ate breakfast&#8230; <em>But today is not that day</em>, Melissa thought to&nbsp;herself.</p>
<p>Lawrence had his morning paper and cup of coffee, Melissa had her morning
newscast and toast. It was their routine; the sole moment in the day that she
would not vary &#8211; it was her tether to the world and to her own sanity. No
matter what mischief Angela would cause throughout the day, it was all
bearable if she&#8217;d had her toast and caught up with the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>She sat down on the chair to Lawrence &#8216;s right, ignoring her daughter&#8217;s
continued pleas for cartoons. “Angela, I said no! Settle down and <em>be quiet</em>!” 
Angela resumed her sulking, but at least it got&nbsp;quiet.</p>
<p>She had just missed the weather report, but she was in time for the morning
headlines. The newscaster droned on with little emotion through the long list
of headlines, and Melissa listened only passively until something caught her&nbsp;attention.</p>
<p>“ Twenty-three-year-old McAllister Park resident Joel Mendocino is dead this
morning, the victim of a car accident at the Franklin-Niles intersection late
last night. Mendocino, who had recently returned from an overseas trip, had
left the Elston Memorial hospital where he was being treated for a near-fatal
gunshot wound he received earlier in the day. His father was the vehicle&#8217;s
driver, and is listed in stable condition at Elston&nbsp;Memorial.”</p>
<p>“ Lawrence , listen to this! This poor kid lived around here!” Lawrence
looked over his paper and murmured an acknowledgement, then resumed reading
his paper. Melissa focused intently on the television as the news anchor&nbsp;continued.</p>
<p>“In related news, police were able to discover an illegal “fight club” of
sorts that is believed to be the source of a rash of unexplained abductions
and beatings of homeless individuals that has been plaguing the city of&nbsp;late.</p>
<p>“In a statement released early this morning, Detective Angus Cobb credited
Mr. Mendocino&#8217;s identification of his attackers as the crucial clue that led
the detectives to a supposedly abandoned warehouse in the ind ustrial area of
the&nbsp;city.</p>
<p>“Several participants in the “fight club” were apprehended by city police
officers, and it is expected that the ringleader will soon be&nbsp;located.”</p>
<p>The news anchor seemed to be enthralled by the story as it continued&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>“But the story doesn&#8217;t end there, folks. Mike Turner, a former Copeland
Advertising executive, was shot and killed by detectives on the scene when he
refused to discontinue his beating of a mentally-challenged homeless man, and
instead charged towards police&nbsp;officers.</p>
<p>“It is believed that Mr. Turner was also responsible for the brutal beating
and death of his wife&#8217;s lover, Brandon Lloyd, a story that we brought to you
yesterday on the 6 o&#8217;clock&nbsp;newscast.</p>
<p>“Police are confident that the criminal&#8217;s behind these recent activities
will soon be rounded up, but remind all city residents to report any
suspicious activity immediately and exercise common sense when moving around
the city at&nbsp;night.”</p>
<p>Melissa was almost sad to realize that the story had come to an end. It was
more interesting than the plot to one of the afternoon soap opera&#8217;s that
Lawrence berated her for watching. Who knew so much could happen one day in
their&nbsp;city?</p>
<p>“Makes you wonder sometimes, doesn&#8217;t it&nbsp;honey?”</p>
<p>“Hmmm?” Lawrence murmured, looking over his newspaper&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>“Makes you wonder how many people you see and interact with each day will be
dead tomorrow. It&#8217;s kind of sad,&nbsp;really.”</p>
<p>Lawrence looked back at his paper. “I suppose. But I don&#8217;t worry too much
about it. After all, what do they have to do with&nbsp;us?”</p>
<p>Melissa stood and ran her dishes under the warm water at the kitchen sink.
She wouldn&#8217;t think about Joel much after that. Lawrence was right, after all;
what did it all have to with&nbsp;her?</p>
<p><strong>Chapter&nbsp;3</strong></p>
<p><em>Joel shrugged as she moved as quickly as she could to the opposite side of
the train, sat down, and eyed him warily.&nbsp;Whatever.</em></p>
<p>While he had traveled in Asia , he&#8217;d been amazed at the hospitality and
friendliness of nearly everyone he met, including the tourists with which he&#8217;d
had the opportunity to converse. All travelers there seemed to be inexplicably
linked; they al shared that undeniable experience that was Asia , and that
experience drew them together. That experience, combined with the basic human
need to communicate, at least occasionally, with people from similar
backgrounds and worldviews, produced a level of camaraderie with some of his
new acquaintances that Joel had seldom had with friends from&nbsp;home.</p>
<p>Two, in particular, Sean and Pang, had become very close to him during the
three days he&#8217;d known them. They had met outside a market while he was staying
in Thailand for a week. Sean had been excited at spotting someone with the
same color skin as his own, and Pang, who&#8217;d spent a year studying at a
university in the States, was glad to have a Westerner with which she could
converse. Pang and Joel hit it off immediately; they both had an affinity for
analytical thought, much to Sean&#8217;s dismay, and spent many of their nights
chatting about philosophy, art, literature and even mathematics, late into the&nbsp;night.</p>
<p>Sean played the dumb oaf, but behind his goofy exterior was a curious, sharp
young man with a razor sharp wit. Together, the three of them had traveled the
city high and low, seeking out coffee shops, bars and pubs, and sampling every
piece of the Thai nightlife that Pang could think to show them. It was hard
for Joel to believe that they&#8217;d only been together for three days before
they&#8217;d split paths. He looked forward to calling them when he got the chance;
their ongoing relationship was an opportunity to relive their past experience
vicariously through each other, and it was an opportunity that Joel was
thankful&nbsp;for.</p>
<p>But it didn&#8217;t stop there. The Asian people he&#8217;d met, from Sumatra to
Thailand , were friendly, eager to please, and very rarely had any desire for
profit, monetary or otherwise. On several occasions, while he&#8217;d carried his
bags to and from a taxi, a random man off the street would run up to assist
him, and many times, refused payment. Their payment was his smile and
gratitude, and in the wake of their unabashed kindness, Joel felt obligated to
at least attempt to repay them by spreading that kindness. It was just too bad
no one could believe he was just trying to be&nbsp;helpful.</p>
<p><em>As the train began to move towards its downtown destination, Joel found an
empty seat and sat down, peering out the window at the cars passing on the
highway alongside&nbsp;him.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chapter&nbsp;8</strong></p>
<p><em>The path along State Avenue to the tower was relatively clear; it was so
late in the morning, a majority of people had already made it to their jobs.</em>
He eyed the homeless men on the corner warily. Why the hell didn&#8217;t they get
jobs? They were always standing there, begging for change, occasionally
offering a useless trinket or piece of shoddy journalism up in&nbsp;exchange.</p>
<p>But even worse than the beggars were the ones with the squeegees. They
attacked his car every single time he drove to work, splashing his windshield
with their vile liquid and doing a piss-poor job of cleaning it off. They
always left his car in worse shape than when they started, and they expected
to get paid! Bull <em>shit</em>! The mere thought of them soured his entire mood
considerably, if it were even possible for him to be more pissed off at this&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>His previous physical activity had left his body reeling, and he was unable
to move faster than a brisk walk towards the tower. He was interrupted several
times by beggars along the way, huddling against the looming stone buildings
for shelter from the wind. He ignored than each time, yelling whatever
obscenities surfaced to his mind first, until finally he slapped at the hands
of the last one, knocking the small collection of nickels and dimes from the
man&#8217;s hand. He smiled cruelly as the man cried out and dropped to his knees to
reclaim the coins that would serve as his dinner for the day. That would show
the&nbsp;bastard.</p>
<p>He continued as fast as he could along State Avenue, ding his best to ignore
the legs&#8217; increasing cries of anguish as they suffocated, until the doors of
the Tower stood before him, peering down at him with a foreboding gaze. <em>He
pushed his way through the revolving doors and ignored the pleasant greetings
of the security guard as he headed straight to the&nbsp;elevator.</em></p>
