                                    <p>My pledge bro Craig &#8220;Rizzy&#8221; Rohe also has a Wii, and he sent me some mini-reviews on some games. Since he has no online presence (yet), I thought I&#8217;d
post them. But before I do that, here&#8217;s what he has to say about getting
online with the&nbsp;thing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, some bitching about&nbsp;Wii:</p>
<p>Up until 10 minutes ago, all I&#8217;ve ever done with the Wii is played games.
Very easy, very fun. However, trying to use the internet connectivity and
adding friends made me want to punch a little Japanese person in the face. Do
they actually expect average people to be able to do this? I&#8217;m an embedded
systems designer, and I was frustrated with it. Other than letting our Mii&#8217;s
travel back and forth, is there even any benefit to doing it? Shame on you&nbsp;Nintendo.</p>
<p>Second, games only save to the internal Wii memory. If you want them on the
<span class="caps">SD</span> card, you have to copy it over manually. Of course, you&#8217;d have to do that
each time you play the game in order to keep the <span class="caps">SD</span> card up to date. It pretty
much makes the $50 1G memory card I bought completely&nbsp;useless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t have said it better myself. The Wii online setup is pretty bad. I&#8217;m
really surprised people are getting it to work without wanting to gouge their
own eyes out with a spoon. As for me, I am still using it on my neighbor&#8217;s
wireless because it won&#8217;t work on mine. And yes, I have changed to channels
1/11 on the router. Yes, I have followed all stupid suggestions in the forums
and on the support site. Nintendo could take a few pointers from Microsoft in
this particular part of the&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">SD</span> thing seems strange. I haven&#8217;t tried to use an <span class="caps">SD</span> card yet, but it does
seem odd that you can&#8217;t save games directly to it. This does seem like
something Nintendo could fix change with a firmware update&nbsp;though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Wii Sports</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s ok. Fun little games to showcase the controller
abilities. I&#8217;ve found tennis to be pretty fun with multiple people, and you
can avoid the dreaded Wii tennis elbow once you learn that a skilled flick of
the wrist will do just as much as a full blown swing. I brought my Wii home
for Christmas, and since I have a zillion siblings we had continuously
rotating doubles matches which were a&nbsp;blast.</p>
<p><strong>Super Monkey Ball</strong> &#8211; I usually only play the mini games. Not as much fun
as the versions for GameCube. I think they tried too hard to incorporate the
motion control into the games, and many of them are just too touchy, or they
should have put more time into making it fun. I guess they were pressed for
time trying to get that one out for launch. There are a few that are pretty
entertaining&nbsp;though.</p>
<p><strong>Zelda: Twilight Princess</strong> &#8211; This game rocks. It&#8217;s hella fun to play. They
used the motion sensors in moderation, which is good. The game itself is
really fun - plenty of puzzles and tangent adventures to try out. I haven&#8217;t
played any Zelda games since the one for 8-bit Nintendo, but I can still
blindly say this is probably the best to&nbsp;date.</p>
<p><strong>Excite Truck</strong> &#8211; So much fun my head almost exploded. It&#8217;s a very fast
paced, physics defying game. There&#8217;s actually a lot of strategy needed for the
more advanced tracks, but at the same time you can just pick a level and have
fun doing 720&#8217;s at 1000 ft in the air and smashing through trees with power-
ups. Definitely one of the best games I&nbsp;own.</p>
<p><strong>Red Steel</strong> &#8211; I haven&#8217;t played this game very much. The reason? My damn
arm gets tired. Another example of how not to design a game interface. I think
it would be much better if I could play for more than 20 mins at a time, so my
review may be biased. Basically, you are required to use the Wii-mote pointer
continuously to aim and steer in the game. That&#8217;s not even too bad because you
could rest your arm on your knee; then they thought up the great idea of
requiring you to extend your arm towards the <span class="caps">TV</span> to zoom in/out. Combine all of
that movement and you have to hold your arm straight out for extended periods
of time during game play. Very annoying. Maybe I need to hit the&nbsp;gym.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Haven&#8217;t gotten into Twilight Princess yet myself. Elebits should be here from
<a href="http://www.gamefly.com/">Gamefly</a> this week, though in retrospect maybe I should have put Excite
Truck at the top of my queue instead. Oh well, way too many awesome games
these days to get to. I still work occasionally, you&nbsp;know.</p>
