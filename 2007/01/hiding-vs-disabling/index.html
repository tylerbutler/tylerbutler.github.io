                                    <p>Someone came by my office today and asked me if I could show him how to make a
column on a SharePoint list required. No problem! While this isn&#8217;t as simple
as it could be, it&#8217;s pretty straightforward. Go into the list you want to
change, select <strong>List Settings</strong> from the <strong>Settings</strong> drop down, then click
the column you want to change in the <strong>List Settings</strong> page. You should see an
option called &#8220;Require that this column contains information.&#8221; By default,
this is off, but turning it on will make the column&nbsp;required.</p>
<p>However, in this case, that option wasn&#8217;t showing in the <span class="caps">UI</span>. The reason was
that the column was a <strong>Yes/No (check box)</strong> field. Now, if you think about
it, this makes sense. A checkbox <em>always</em> has state, either checked or
unchecked, so it&#8217;s by nature required. A user always has to fill in a checkbox
with some data, either by checking it or unchecking it. It all comes down to
the default state, which <em>is</em> settable in the SharePoint&nbsp;<span class="caps">UI</span>.</p>
<p>The interesting thing here, though, is that the user didn&#8217;t stop to think
about this. And that makes sense. He just wanted to make a column required; he
didn&#8217;t think about what type of column it was. SharePoint totally removes the
required field setting from the <span class="caps">UI</span> for Yes/No fields because it doesn&#8217;t make
sense. However, the user got confused. He wasn&#8217;t sure if the <span class="caps">UI</span> was missing by
design or if he wasn&#8217;t looking in the right spot for the setting. If you have
a task to accomplish using relatively unfamiliar <span class="caps">UI</span>, you go to the place that
makes sense to you, but you&#8217;re never sure you&#8217;re in the right place. In this
case, the user poked around other parts of the <span class="caps">UI</span> before coming to me, because
he thought he was looking in the wrong&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>This might be alleviated by disabling (i.e. graying out) the part of the <span class="caps">UI</span>
that is not applicable. This is somewhat clearer, because it says, &#8220;Yes, this
is where you would change this setting, but it doesn&#8217;t make sense here or is
not allowed.&#8221; This isn&#8217;t a hard rule. You can&#8217;t <em>always</em> display <em>all</em>
possible settings in one piece of <span class="caps">UI</span> because if there are a large number of
settings, things can get confusing and distracting. Some hiding does make
sense in many cases. But it is worth some dedicated thought about your <span class="caps">UI</span> and
what your users are trying to accomplish when deciding whether to hide a piece
of <span class="caps">UI</span> or simply gray it&nbsp;out.</p>
