                                    <p>I&#8217;ve been avoiding services like Facebook, MySpace, Friendster and the like
for a long time despite their growing popularity. In the MySpace case, it&#8217;s a
philosophical choice &#8211; MySpace sites are often so bad! They look horrible,
music plays when you go to them, the formatting is terrible… This is a natural
outcome of pure freedom; when you allow people to customize things and make
them look exactly like they want, you give them the freedom to make horrible
looking stuff. But I&#8217;m getting a bit off topic… Anyway, I avoid MySpace sort
of on principal, but I avoid Facebook due to some other reasons that I think
finally crystallized in my mind while attending a roundtable discussion at <span class="caps">MIX</span>
that included folks from Six Apart, Twitter, and&nbsp;Facebook.</p>
<p>The guy from Facebook was talking about how they view Facebook as being not an
<em>extension</em> of your identity, but rather a <em>representation</em> of it (my words,
not his; I&#8217;m trying to paraphrase the conversation). In other words, your
Facebook simply reflects the things that are happening to you, what&#8217;s going on
in your life, etc., and then shortens the gap between those events and
occurrences and the people that potentially care about you. Their philosophy
as I understand it is to reduce the amount of overhead that comes with keeping
track of what&#8217;s going on with&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a noble goal, I suppose, and one I can certainly appreciate given that
I have friends strewn all over the world (ever since the great Diaspora that
was my high school graduation in <span class="caps">PNG</span>). It certainly would be nice to always
know what was happening with those folks without ever having to do anything
about it. But I think that&#8217;s the crux of my opposition to&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>You see, I think there is a great deal of worth in getting an email after a
long time from someone who has taken the time to write you and give you a
brief update about them. It took time and energy for them to write you and
update you on their life &#8211; and I believe it shows they care. This type of rich
interaction with someone occurs more naturally after a time out of&nbsp;touch.</p>
<p>Imagine a 30-year high-school reunion if everyone was on Facebook the entire
time after graduation? Would there be anything to talk about? I suppose the
conversation would revolve around politics, religion, and other matters of
<em>opinion</em>, because life events would simply be old news. Everyone would
already know that Sam got married last summer and Mary got a new job. There&#8217;d
be no excitement in learning that Joe&#8217;s son spoke his first words last week or
that Sally was finally able to get that surgery she&nbsp;needed.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re always connected to one another all the time, it removes the
excitement and enjoyment that comes from the <em>re</em>-connecting after a
disconnect. It&#8217;s cliché, to be sure, but absence makes the heart grow fonder,
and for that reason, Facebook&#8217;s just not for&nbsp;me.</p>
