                                    <p>A friend gave this to me. It&#8217;s written by a girl somewhere, and is available
online at <a href="http://www.stwing.upenn.edu/~jenf/writing/rant04.html">http://www.stwing.upenn.edu/~jenf/writing/rant04.html</a>. I like
it. It&#8217;s well-written and very on point. As a &#8220;nice guy,&#8221; or <a href="http://www.intellectualwhores.com/">Intellectual
Whore</a>, as some have called it, I identified very well with the topic. May
my vindication come&nbsp;quickly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ode to the Nice&nbsp;Guys</strong></p>
<p><em>This rant was written for the Wharton Undergraduate&nbsp;Journal</em></p>
<p>This is a tribute to the nice guys. The nice guys that finish last, that
never become more than friends, that endure hours of whining and bitching
about what assholes guys are, while disproving the very point. This is
dedicated to those guys who always provide a shoulder to lean on but restrain
themselves to tentative hugs, those guys who hold open doors and give
reassuring pats on the back and sit patiently outside the changing room at
department stores. This is in honor of the guys that obligingly reiterate how
cute/beautiful/smart/funny/sexy their female friends are at the appropriate
moment, because they know most girls need that litany of support. This is in
honor of the guys with open minds, with laid-back attitudes, with honest
concern. This is in honor of the guys who respect a girl&#8217;s every facet, from
her privacy to her theology to her clothing&nbsp;style.</p>
<p>This is for the guys who escort their drunk, bewildered female friends back
from parties and never take advantage once they&#8217;re at her door, for the guys
who accompany girls to bars as buffers against the rest of the creepy male
population, for the guys who know a girl is fishing for compliments but give
them out anyway, for the guys who always play by the rules in a game where the
rules favor cheaters, for the guys who are accredited as boyfriend material
but somehow don&#8217;t end up being boyfriends, for all the nice guys who are
overlooked, underestimated, and unappreciated, for all the nice guys who are
manipulated, misled, and unjustly abandoned, this is for&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>This is for that time she left 40 urgent messages on your cell phone, and
when you called her back, she spent three hours painstakingly dissecting two
sentences her boyfriend said to her over dinner. And even though you thought
her boyfriend was a chump and a jerk, you assured her that it was all ok and
she shouldn&#8217;t worry about it. This is for that time she interrupted the best
killing spree you&#8217;d ever orchestrated in <span class="caps">GTA3</span> to rant about a rumor that
romantically linked her and the guy she thinks is the most repulsive person in
the world. And even though you thought it was immature and you had nothing
against the guy, you paused the game for two hours and helped her concoct a
counter-rumor to spread around the floor. This is also for that time she
didn&#8217;t have a date, so after numerous vows that there was nothing “serious”
between the two of you, she dragged you to a party where you knew nobody, the
beer was awful, and she flirted shamelessly with you, justifying each fit of
reckless teasing by announcing to everyone: “oh, but we&#8217;re just friends!” And
even though you were invited purely as a symbolic warm body for her ego, you
went anyways. Because you&#8217;re nice like&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>The nice guys don&#8217;t often get credit where credit is due. And perhaps more
disturbing, the nice guys don&#8217;t seem to get laid as often as they should. And
I wish I could logically explain this trend, but I can&#8217;t. From what I have
observed on campus and what I have learned from talking to friends at other
schools and in the workplace, the only conclusion I can form is that many
girls are just illogical, manipulative bitches. Many of them claim they just
want to date a nice guy, but when presented with such a specimen, they say
irrational, confusing things such as “oh, he&#8217;s too nice to date” or “he would
be a good boyfriend but he&#8217;s not for me” or “he already puts up with so much
from me, I couldn&#8217;t possibly ask him out!” or the most frustrating of all:
“no, it would ruin our friendship.” Yet, they continue to lament the lack of
datable men in the world, and they expect their too-nice-to-date male friends
to sympathize and apologize for the men that are jerks. Sorry, guys, girls
like that are beyond my ability to fathom. I can&#8217;t figure out why the
connection breaks down between what they say (<em>I want a nice guy!</em>) and what
they do (<em>I&#8217;m going to sleep with this complete ass now!</em>). But one thing I
can do, is say that the nice-guy-finishes-last phenomenon doesn&#8217;t last
forever. There are definitely many girls who grow out of that train of thought
and realize they should be dating the nice guys, not taking them for granted.
The tricky part is finding those girls, and even trickier, finding the ones
that are&nbsp;single.</p>
<p>So, until those girls are found, I propose a toast to all the nice guys. You
know who you are, and I know you&#8217;re sick of hearing yourself described as
ubiquitously nice. But the truth of the matter is, the world needs your
patience in the department store, your holding open of doors, your party
escorting services, your propensity to be a sucker for a pretty smile. For all
the crazy, inane, absurd things you tolerate, for all the situations where you
are the faceless, nameless hero, my accolades, my acknowledgement, and my
gratitude go out to you. You do have credibility in this society, and your
well deserved vindication is&nbsp;coming.</p>
