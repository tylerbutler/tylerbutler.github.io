                                    <p>eBay used to be safe, and for the most part, I suppose it still is. The honest
people in the world still outnumber the dishonest ones, and I hope it stays
that way forever. But anyone who has used eBay a fair amount has gotten
scammed at least once or twice, or at the very least, received emails from
people fishing for a gullible seller/buyer to scam. I myself paid for a
relatively expensive item that was never sent to me. Luckily, in that case, I
was protected because I went through eBay and they refunded my money. Of
course, I was out a few hundred bucks for about three months while I went
through their fraud process. That pretty much sucks for someone on a
shoestring budget like me (though one has to wonder just how shoestring my
budget is if I can spend hundreds of dollars on eBay&#8230; yup, I&#8217;m enigmatic
like&nbsp;that&#8230;).</p>
<p>Anyway, I saw a story on Slashdot about an eBay scammer, and eventually found
this site, <a href="http://www.p-p-p-powerbook.com/">P-P-P-Powerbook.com</a>, that chronicles a relatively recent
(April/May 2004) scam story. It&#8217;s really really funny, and there are some
awesome pictures to go with it. I have the <span class="caps">PDF</span> document shared on here, but
I&#8217;d really recommend checking the site as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tough to explain quickly what exactly happened. I guess the really
important thing is that the seller, who was trying to sell an Apple Powerbook,
was contacted by a scammer who wanted to buy the Powerbook through an Escrow
site. Eventually the seller decided to scam this scammer, and eventually sent
him a P-P-P-Powerbook, picturres of which are below. Anyway, the story is
quite long and involved, but very humorous, so I&#8217;d recommend checking it out.
Some of my favorite picutres are below (there are more in the <span class="caps">PDF</span> and at the
site). Oh, and there&#8217;s also a hilarious site that offers <a href="http://bu.dotsomething.net/powerbook/ppppstore.html">P-P-P-Powerbooks for
sale</a>. It looks pretty&nbsp;legitimate&#8230;</p>
