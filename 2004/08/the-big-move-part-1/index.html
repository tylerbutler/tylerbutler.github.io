                                    <p>I have been looking for a new apartment for what seems like forever. I started
out with 5 other roommates, but when they decided to go into a house that just
wasn&#8217;t up to my standards, I struck out on my own and started looking for one-
bedroom places. Unfortunately, the search was tough. Many places I looked at
were either in fairly bad shape or just too expensive for the size. I was
getting pretty discouraged, especially since my financial situation isn&#8217;t
exactly great and time was running&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>On Saturday of last week (August 7) I looked at a 2 1/2 room studio apartment
on Hamilton Avenue, close to the corner of 35th and Archer. I liked what I saw
- and I liked the price, too. It was a little further from campus than I had
hoped (about a 15-minute drive, depending on the lights), but it had beautiful
hardwood floors, a large walk-in closet, and was in pretty good shape. It also
smelled great, which, considering some of the other places I looked at, was a
definite plus. The landlord was understanding of my financial situation, and I
explained to him that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to pay until later the following week
because <a href="/2004/08/i-hate-banks/">my bank is stupid</a>. That was fine with him, so I crossed my
fingers and waited until Friday so my bank would finally ackowledge that I had
the necessary funds in my account (have I mentioned yet that <a href="/2004/08/i-hate-banks/">I despise
banks?</a>).</p>
<p>Thankfully (and miraculously), my bank cleared the funds just before I needed
to make the withdrawal for the security deposit and first month&#8217;s rent. I
headed over to the landlord&#8217;s office, got everything in order, and had the
keys in my hand in less than an hour. It felt really good to have the keys in
my hand. I grabbed Alex&#8217;s camera and headed over to get some pictures before I
destroyed the place with my stuff. Some of the best ones are here. Others are
available in the download section. Click on the photos below to get an
even bigger&nbsp;photo.</p>
