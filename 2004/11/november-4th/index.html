                                    <p><strong>Chapter 4:&nbsp;Mike</strong></p>
<p>_Come on, come on&#8230; Just start already! _Another wheeze and gasp from the
engine, but it still wouldn&#8217;t fully turn over. “Dammit!” Mike shouted as he
smashed his right fist down against the front dashboard, cracking the brittle,
sun-bleached plastic of the air&nbsp;vents.</p>
<p>The day had not been going well. Come to think of it, the week, the month,
the <em>year</em> had not been going well. But today had been especially trying.
Marie had given him crap again for coming in late last night, he&#8217;d overslept
and got on the highway later than he&#8217;d hoped (no thanks to Marie, who hadn&#8217;t
been persistent enough in making roll out of bed), and now the car was <em>not</em>&nbsp;cooperating.</p>
<p>This was ridiculous. Any other day but this one! Today was important! Today
was the meeting about the Richmond account &#8211; his account. An account that he
had nursed from its infancy at Copeland. An account that he had brought to the
company himself. Copeland didn&#8217;t even know Richmond <em>existed</em> until he&#8217;d
brought it in. And he&#8217;d turned the account into a cash cow. Mike Turner was
totally responsible for turning Copeland Advertising into a large, well-
respected firm, and he wasn&#8217;t getting any credit at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Not enough, anyway. And these new executives &#8211; young enough to be his
children &#8211; were coming in, acting like _they&#8217;d _ built the company, yanking
his talented staff away and putting them under other, less adept leaders. Then
they had the audacity to complain when the returns on the Richmond account
weren&#8217;t as high as usual. How could he be expected to produce results when
they were giving crappy, unskilled kids to work with? Most of these kids
didn&#8217;t know Z-Form advertising from their ass. And he was expected not only to
train them, but use them to produce high-quality advertising for the company&#8217;s
biggest account. Yeah, right, the logic made&nbsp;sense.</p>
<p>And these kids &#8211; all they knew how to do was use a computer. If they
couldn&#8217;t do it digitally, they couldn&#8217;t do it. Not an ounce of artistic talent
between them. They only knew how to click a few buttons, move a cursor around
a screen, and hit the print key. Mike had come in with a few physical mock-ups
and these kids were amazed. “This must have taken you so long,” they
exclaimed. Damn kids, with their skateboards, their body-art, their Japanese
anime bullshit. They didn&#8217;t know jack about advertising. How the hell did they
get&nbsp;degrees?</p>
<p>Today was the day he was going to fix the problems. The bigwigs upstairs
wanted to talk Richmond , and Mike was ready. He&#8217;d prepared several new ideas
for the account, and had outlined a plan to rejuvenate Copeland&#8217;s advertising
efforts. He&#8217;d even formulated a sound argument to get some of the more
seasoned staff back on his team. Surely they could listen to reason. After
all, it was the least the company could do for him. And the Richmond guys were
ready to sign a contract renewal, provided Mike could produce some quality
mock-ups for the new campaign. A renewed contract meant a bonus for Mike &#8211; a
bonus he desperately&nbsp;needed.</p>
<p>But now the damn car wouldn&#8217;t start. He&#8217;d asked Marie three weeks ago to
take it to the mechanic while he was at work, but apparently she hadn&#8217;t. She
wasn&#8217;t good for much of anything these days. She was a decent cook, though,
and he kept her around as a back-up if he couldn&#8217;t get any from the younger,
more lithe interns. A man had needs,&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>Besides, in his occupation, he needed a wife &#8211; someone he could bring to
company functions and provide his account-holders a sense of stability and
constancy. The latest in a string of vacuous office biddies wasn&#8217;t the best
choice for a dinner companion if clients were present; they needed to see him
as reliable, honest, and consistent, even if none of those words had ever
accurately described&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>This was ridiculous. The anger of the surrounding drivers on the highway was
mounting quickly, and they sped by him honking their horns and screaming
obscenities in his general direction. What was he going to do? He could call a
tow truck, but by the time they arrived and he made it downtown, he&#8217;d have
missed the meeting and his opportunity to get things back on track at Copeland
would be gone. He already felt he was on thin ice with many of the executives
– he couldn&#8217;t afford to make a bad impression at this&nbsp;meeting.</p>
<p>So what was he going to do? He slammed his fist on the dash again, sending
pieces of broken plastic flying, and dialed Marie on his cell. No answer.
Where the hell was she? There was absolutely no reason she wouldn&#8217;t be picking
up this early in the morning. Dammit, <em>dammit</em>, <strong><em>dammit</em></strong>! He hit the
dash three more times for emphasis, this time driving plastic splinters into
his knuckles. He didn&#8217;t care. He had to get&nbsp;downtown.</p>
<p>There was more riding on this meeting than anyone realized. He <em>needed</em>
that bonus, and in order to get the bonus, had had to convince the execs to
give him his old team back. And to do that, he <em>had</em> to get to the meeting!
It was a chain of events, all connected and reliant on the other, and he
couldn&#8217;t afford to screw any one of them up at this&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>In a moment of sudden clarity, Mike noticed the train track to his left,
running parallel to the highway. How close was he to a station? He could see
the outline of the Whoorsley station in the distance ahead of him. Could he
make it on foot? He glanced back and saw the light of an approaching train
pulling to a stop at the faraway Allerton stop. He&#8217;d have to chance&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>He threw the door of his black Mercedes open, grabbed his briefcase, and
dodged oncoming traffic and verbal assaults over to the shoulder. He briefly
looked back at the car; he&#8217;d probably never see it again, but it was a small
price to&nbsp;pay.</p>
<p>He loosened his tie and began to run towards Whoorsley as fast as he could.
He hadn&#8217;t run like this since college, and his body apparently took great
pleasure in reminding him of that fact with burning lungs, rubbery legs, and
the complexion of a pickled beet. And this was only the first hundred&nbsp;feet.</p>
<p>The train passed him with about 1000 feet left. He felt as if his lungs were
going to explode, but he kept going. He had to. Mike was not a religious man;
he hadn&#8217;t prayed since he was a small child kneeling at his bedside, hands
folded, but he prayed harder than he ever had that something, some <em>one</em>,
would make that train wait. If he could make it, he might be able to make it
all the way downtown and still have a few minutes to take the elevator up to
the&nbsp;office.</p>
<p>And the train waited. Time just seemed to stop. The rest of the world kept
moving, but that train was rooted, statue-like, at the Whoorsley station. Mike
kept running, sweat pouring from his brow, legs numb, lungs pumping furiously,
blood oozing from the dashboard-incurred injury he hadn&#8217;t even noticed yet. He
made it to the rear car and literally fell into it. The passengers looked at
him strangely, but he didn&#8217;t care. He&#8217;d made it, somehow. Perhaps this day
wasn&#8217;t going to be so bad after&nbsp;all.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5: The&nbsp;Corner</strong></p>
<p>Ernie stepped his way back along Sullivan Street . The music was roaring in
his ears again. The walk would get him warmed up; he&#8217;d be more than prepared
to take on the kids at 34 th and Broadway by the time he&nbsp;arrived.</p>
<p>Some of the kids on “the corner,” as it was known to those in the elite
circle of participants, resented Ernie&#8217;s presence, but no one could deny that
he could move. Ken was sure to set straight anyone who argued about Ernie&#8217;s
participation. Ken understood that despite appearances, Ernie wasn&#8217;t a grown-
up, and the rest of the kids had nothing to fear from&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>A rising rhythm in the music caused a requisite wave to ripple through
Ernie&#8217;s body. He loved that part of the song. In a sudden burst of
inspiration, he jumped up, spun 180 degrees and landed on his back heels,
still moving the same direction. A new move! He didn&#8217;t discover that many
anymore. He&#8217;d have to try that out at the corner today. It would drive the
kids nuts &#8211; especially&nbsp;Karen.</p>
<p>Ken teased Ernie all the time about his crush on Karen. He tried to deny it,
but he had to admit to himself that it was true. There was something about the
way she shook her body while out on the floor, moved her hips back and forth,
and seemed to look right through him when their eyes met&#8230; he grinned. She
should be there today, and armed with a new move, he was sure to impress&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>He rounded the corner and made his way along the Dominick&#8217;s parking lot. He
stole a glance in the storefront window, searching for the nice girl with the
blonde hair and a metal bar in her eye. Ernie had always found the piercing
strange &#8211; why someone would do that to their body was beyond his comprehension
– but she had been friendly to him, providing him with the occasional sandwich
or soda on a warm day, so he eventually accepted the shiny metal accessory as
a part of&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>She was kind to all the residents, past and present, of St. Ives, and many
others that had never set foot there. She always had some spare change, a kind
word, or a candy bar, or <em>something</em>. She often brought a pizza out on her
lunch brea k and dined with the less fortunate in the lot, or, during the
winner, brought small mugs of del iciously warm hot chocolate for&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Ernie could nev er remember her name, but he&#8217;d nev er forget her face. She
always took the time to talk to him when she could, and he appreciated it. She
reminded him of Rho nda, but he could nev er remember her name. She&#8217;d told it
to him many times, but it wouldn&#8217;t stick. She always giggled when he repeated
it countless times in her presence to make sure he&#8217;d know it for next time.
Perhaps he forgot it just so he could make her laugh again the next time they&nbsp;met.</p>
<p>There she was in the store, scanning items over the laser reader and smiling
at the customers. She didn&#8217;t see him, but he didn&#8217;t have time to try and get
her attention. Ken would be waiting at the&nbsp;corner.</p>
<p>In fact, Ken came out to meet him a couple blocks before the&nbsp;corner.</p>
<p>“Hey, Ern, didja hear?” Ernie nodded in&nbsp;confusion.</p>
<p>“Somethin&#8217;s going on down by the store. Cops and everything! Come on, lets
go check it out!” Ken whizzed by on his bike, made a wide u-turn, and pedaled
up beside&nbsp;Ernie.</p>
<p>“Man, I hope we can see somethin&#8217;. Maybe there&#8217;ll be a body and everything!
Wouldn&#8217;t that be awesome?” Ernie wasn&#8217;t entirely sure he was ready to witness
a dead body. He certainly wasn&#8217;t as excited as Ken, but with something this
exciting going on, it was doubtful anyone would be at the corner&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>The fla shing red and blue of the emergency vehicles were visible a few
blocks from the convenience store. Ken sped up and pedaled on ahead, leaving
Ernie alone with his thoughts for a few moments. All he really wanted to do
was jive down on the corner. Maybe he should just go back towards St. Ives and
jive by himself for the day. No, eventually the kids would get bored or
realize they weren&#8217;t going to see anything, and the corner would ramp back up
to it&#8217;s usual buzz of activity. He&#8217;d just have to wait it&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>As he approached Ken&#8217;s chosen vantage point, men in blue police uniforms
were wheeling a gurney into the back of an&nbsp;ambulance.</p>
<p>“Well, they ain&#8217;t in no hurry. He must already be dead. Come on, let&#8217;s go
take a look!” Ernie groaned inwardly, but followed Ken as he clandestinely cut
up the alley behind the store and emerged beside the nearly deserted far side
of the&nbsp;ambulance.</p>
<p>“Come on, Ern, lift me up,” Ken whispered, gesturing at the small side
window of the ambulance. Ernie grasped Ken under his arms and heaved him
towards the window, holding him steady as he himself peeked in the&nbsp;window.</p>
<p>Ernie dropped Ken hard on the pavement as his vision cleared and he
recognized who it was on the&nbsp;gurney.</p>
<p>It was&nbsp;Darryl.</p>
