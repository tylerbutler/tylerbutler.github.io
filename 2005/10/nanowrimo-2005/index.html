                                    <p>November is nigh upon me, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to fully participate
in <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> this year like <a href="/2004/11/tyler-a-novelist/">I did last year</a>. Between the job
and the working out, I&#8217;m simply not going to have the time for a 50,000
word novel this year. It really is a shame, since I had a couple of good
ideas. Oh well, store them up for the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>I am, however, considering trying to complete a short story during the month.
I have a few ideas&#8230; They&#8217;re listed below, along with some possible quotes
from the story and some pros and cons about doing one. After you&#8217;ve read the
descriptions, vote for your favorite on the left of the&nbsp;site&#8230;</p>
<h2>Sex, Drugs, and&nbsp;Polka</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A semi-autobiographical story about a guy who goes to
college and deals with the overall college experience. He figures most of it
out, but the fairer sex leaves him utterly confused &#8211; that is, until he meets
<em>her</em>. (This makes it sound really cheesy &#8211; I don&#8217;t think it will be once I
get it&nbsp;written.)</p>
<p><strong>Possible&nbsp;excerpts:</strong> </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Years later he would think back in awe of the
squander in which he now lived &#8211; but at this very moment, it was home, and a
good one at&nbsp;that.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>He had the fleeting thought that all men of his generation had. &#8216;Am I&nbsp;gay?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>In his heart he knew that what he really wanted was a meaningful relationship
filled with trust, sacrifice, and love, culminating in marriage and a slow
ride into the proverbial sunset of his later years with his beautiful bride;
for now, though, he&#8217;d settle for a passionate make-out session in the corner
with some girl whose name he wouldn&#8217;t remember&nbsp;tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Will give me a chance to get some of my college experiences out on
paper (with some fictional embellishments, of course) before middle-age sets
in and I forget it all. Plus, would be a lot of fun for my friends to read
since they&#8217;ll probably make&nbsp;appearances.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Far too much for a short story &#8211; I doubt I&#8217;ll ever finish it once
I start, because there&#8217;s too much material to work&nbsp;with.</p>
<h2>The&nbsp;Hill</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A children&#8217;s story about friendship. A boy grows up with a
hill in his back yard, and when he grows older, a construction company buys
the property and threatens to flatten the hill, so the boy has to find a way
to save it &#8211; or say&nbsp;goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>Possible excerpts:</strong> Hmmm, I can&#8217;t find them right now&#8230; I know they&#8217;re&nbsp;somewhere&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> I like to experiment with different styles (Mike&#8217;s character in
<a href="/tags/novel/">Knot</a> was an experiment with anger and rage), so it would be interesting
to try my hand at a children&#8217;s story, with some simpler language and richer
descriptions. The presence of a non-talking character (the Hill) would allow
me to forgo dialog and focus more on description (one of my weaker points, I&nbsp;think).</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Might be kind of boring, and difficult to prevent sounding cheesy
or overly didactic. The core concept isn&#8217;t very original&nbsp;either.</p>
<h2>The Children&#8217;s&nbsp;Democracy</h2>
<p><strong>Description: </strong>A lonely suburban writer suffers writer&#8217;s block until he
starts to observe a group of kids around his housing complex. He writes about
his observations about the way the children deal with each other socially and&nbsp;politically.</p>
<p><strong>Possible excerpts:</strong> Probably the same place <strong>The Hill</strong> excerpts are&#8230;
I&#8217;ll put them in here when I locate&nbsp;them&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Interesting concept to me, and I&#8217;d get to alternate between
analytical essay-style writing, description, and dialog pretty easily with the&nbsp;characters.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Very little subject matter to use, since I don&#8217;t have too much
interaction with kids. The idea is based on some run-ins I&#8217;ve had with some of
the kids around my apartment complex, but I don&#8217;t think I have nearly enough
material to keep this&nbsp;interesting.</p>
<p>Have another plot idea you think I should write about? Let me&nbsp;know&#8230;</p>
