                                    <p>One of the many benefits of working at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> is the relatively
little-known weight management benefit. Essentially, the benefit pays for a
large majority of a diet/weight loss/exercise program administered by the <a href="http://www.proclub.com/">Pro
Club</a>, the semi-official Microsoft sports club. I found out about it fairly
soon after I started, and I knew I wanted to get involved, but I didn&#8217;t have
the time. Finally, about a month ago, I took the plunge and got things&nbsp;going.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been overweight for as long as I can remember, and though I&#8217;ve been
relatively static the past few years in terms of weight gain, I&#8217;ve known for
awhile that I need to do something about it. Since I&#8217;m making use of all the
other Microsoft benefits (getting my teeth fixed, medical check-ups, etc) I
figured I might as well do&nbsp;everything.</p>
<p>Anyway, I officially started on the diet last Thursday and the exercise the
previous day. This week I&#8217;ve lost <strong>13.6 pounds.</strong> That&#8217;s a lot, I know, but I
should put this in perspective. I work out 90 minutes 3 days a week with a
personal trainer, and 60 minutes 3 more days a week by myself. I bought a
heart rate monitor and with the help of Jeremiah, my trainer, am learning how
to do heart-rate-focused work-outs. But the big thing last week was the&nbsp;diet…</p>
<p>Basically I ate nothing but chicken, protein shakes, and a little peanut
butter. The dietitian called it ‘detox&#8217; and she was right. I had withdrawal
symptoms including severe headaches and numbness in my hands and feet for the
first 4-5 days. It seems like most of it has passed though, and fortunately
this week I get to add veggies back into my diet. I went out for a salad at
lunch and it was quite possibly the best thing I&#8217;ve ever had in my entire life
after 7 days of chicken and protein shakes. I also talked about my aversion to
the protein shakes (I had to drink 5 per day, so I was getting pretty sick of
them) with the dietician and she moved me to another diet without the&nbsp;shakes.</p>
<p>I was having a lot of trouble keeping my calories up. I&#8217;m supposed to eat
between 1500 and 1600 a day, but last week I averaged ~1300. I was sluggish
and mentally challenged the whole week, so I am eager to get my count back up
so I can feel better while still losing the weight and eating better. I think
I&#8217;ll be a little happier now with the variety. Plus, with the veggies back and
yogurt coming back next week, I should be good to&nbsp;go.</p>
<p>I am pleased with the progress so far, but I do miss the freedom I exercised
previously when it came to food. As things go on, I&#8217;ll be adding more food
groups back in, so I should be <span class="caps">OK</span>. The weirdest thing about the whole program
is the counseling stuff. The counselor is awesome, and I only meet with here
once a month or so, but she gave me a business card that just said Sara
S&#8212;&#8211;, Psychotherapy. That word just seems scary to me, especially since I
don&#8217;t consider myself psychotic or even ‘troubled&#8217; but&nbsp;whatever.</p>
<p>Anyway, 1 week down, 19 left to&nbsp;go.</p>
