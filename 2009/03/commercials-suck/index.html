                                    <p>This article, titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/05/AR2009030504104.html?hpid=topnews">Give Us a Commercial Break!</a>&#8221; from the Wall Street
Journal is <strong>way</strong> off the mark in my opinion. The article states that <span class="caps">TV</span>
shows are written with commercials in mind and that watching them without
commercials changes them. That in and of itself I can&#8217;t argue with. But I do
take issue with the implication that this is uniformly&nbsp;bad.</p>
<p>There are two core arguments in the&nbsp;article:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="caps">TV</span> shows are written with commercials specifically in mind, and removing them completely interrupts the pacing of the&nbsp;show. </li>
<li>Viewers actually like shows with ads&nbsp;better.</li>
</ol>
<p>For argument number one, it&#8217;s obvious that writers take commercial breaks into
consideration when writing <span class="caps">TV</span> shows. However, in their <span class="caps">DVD</span> counterparts, the
breaks are preserved as scene changes. These can seem rather abrupt, and I
think this points to an alternative solution: slightly longer breaks for scene
changes that are replacing commercial breaks. If we assume the normal scene
change is a second, then imagine that the commercial-break-replacement scene
change is three seconds. You can simulate this suggestion by hitting pause for
three seconds – I think you&#8217;ll be surprised at the results. I think you&#8217;ll
agree that this is uniformly better than&nbsp;ads.</p>
<p>For argument number two, I can&#8217;t refute the research. But there is a quote
from the article that is completely asinine in my&nbsp;opinion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From an audience member&#8217;s perspective, they are what makes network
television social. We use the commercial breaks to talk amongst ourselves, to
take bets on the J.D./Elliot situation and to decide that no one ever really
dies on&nbsp;&#8220;Lost.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Say what? That we need commercial breaks to be social is ridiculous. In this
day and age, we have ready access to the Pause button, and it&#8217;s a far more
useful tool for fostering discussion while watching <span class="caps">TV</span>. <a href="http://twitter.com/elizabethfrench">Elizabeth</a> and I
have been watching quite a few documentaries lately, and we pause quite often
to talk about whether or not we agree with what&#8217;s being said. I agree that
adding discussion and dialog while viewing a show is positive (there&#8217;s a
reason fans get together to watch episodes of their favorite shows), but I
think people use the commercial breaks because they&#8217;re there, not because they
<strong>need</strong> them in order to have that conversation&nbsp;successfully.</p>
<p>I hate ads in all forms (though I can appreciate particularly clever or well-
done ones), so I am definitely biased here. But seriously&#8230; there&#8217;s a reason
<span class="caps">DVD</span> copies of shows sell so well, and it isn&#8217;t because people are dying to own
season one of “Scrubs” for&nbsp;eternity&#8230;</p>
